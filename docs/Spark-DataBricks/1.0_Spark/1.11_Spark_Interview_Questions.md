# Common Spark Concepts which may be asked in an interview

In this article I will try to put some common Spark concepts in a tabular format(So that its compact). These are good concepts to remember. Also, they may be asked in Interview questions.

## Types of join strateries

| **Join Strategy**                   | **Description**                                                                                                 | **Use Case**                                                                 | **Example**                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shuffle Hash Join                   | Both DataFrames are shuffled based on the join keys, and then a hash join is performed.                         | Useful when both DataFrames are large and have a good distribution of keys.  | `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin", "false")`<br>`df1.join(df2, "key")` |
| Broadcast Hash Join                 | One of the DataFrames is small enough to fit in memory and is broadcasted to all worker nodes. A hash join is then performed. | Efficient when one DataFrame is much smaller than the other.                | `val broadcastDF = broadcast(df2)`<br>`df1.join(broadcastDF, "key")` |
| Sort-Merge Join                     | Both DataFrames are sorted on the join keys and then merged. This requires a shuffle if the data is not already sorted. | Suitable for large DataFrames when the join keys are sorted or can be sorted efficiently. | `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin", "true")`<br>`df1.join(df2, "key")` |
| Cartesian Join (Cross Join)         | Every row of one DataFrame is paired with every row of the other DataFrame.                                     | Generally not recommended due to its computational expense, but can be used for generating combinations of all rows. | `df1.crossJoin(df2)`                                              |
| Broadcast Nested Loop Join          | The smaller DataFrame is broadcasted, and a nested loop join is performed.                                      | Used when there are no join keys or the join condition is complex and cannot be optimized with hash or sort-merge joins. | `val broadcastDF = broadcast(df2)`<br>`df1.join(broadcastDF)`    |
| Shuffle-and-Replicate Nested Loop Join | Both DataFrames are shuffled and replicated to perform a nested loop join.                                      | Used for complex join conditions that cannot be handled by other join strategies. | `df1.join(df2, expr("complex_condition"))`                       |

## Types of Joins

| **Join Type**       | **Description**                                                                                     | **Example**                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Inner Join          | Returns rows that have matching values in both DataFrames.                                          | `df1.join(df2, "key")`                              |
| Outer Join          | Returns all rows when there is a match in either DataFrame. Missing values are filled with nulls.    | `df1.join(df2, Seq("key"), "outer")`                |
| Left Outer Join     | Returns all rows from the left DataFrame, and matched rows from the right DataFrame.                 | `df1.join(df2, Seq("key"), "left_outer")`           |
| Right Outer Join    | Returns all rows from the right DataFrame, and matched rows from the left DataFrame.                 | `df1.join(df2, Seq("key"), "right_outer")`          |
| Left Semi Join      | Returns only the rows from the left DataFrame that have a match in the right DataFrame.              | `df1.join(df2, Seq("key"), "left_semi")`            |
| Left Anti Join      | Returns only the rows from the left DataFrame that do not have a match in the right DataFrame.       | `df1.join(df2, Seq("key"), "left_anti")`            |
| Cross Join          | Returns the Cartesian product of both DataFrames. Every row in the left DataFrame will be combined with every row in the right DataFrame. | `df1.crossJoin(df2)`                                |
| Self Join           | A join in which a DataFrame is joined with itself. This can be an inner, outer, left, or right join. | `df.join(df, df("key1") === df("key2"))`            |

## Common Spark optimization techniques

| **Technique**                    | **What it is**                                      | **When to use**                                        | **Example**                                                |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Caching and Persistence**      | Storing data in memory for quick access             | When you need to reuse the same data multiple times     | ```scala val cachedData = df.cache() ```                   |
| **Broadcast Variables**          | Sending a small dataset to all worker nodes         | When one dataset is much smaller than the other         | ```scala val broadcastData = spark.broadcast(smallDF) largeDF.join(broadcastData.value, "key") ``` |
| **Partitioning**                 | Dividing data into smaller, manageable chunks       | When dealing with large datasets to improve parallel processing | ```scala val partitionedData = df.repartition(10, $"key") ``` |
| **Avoiding Shuffles**            | Reducing the movement of data between nodes         | To improve performance by minimizing network overhead   | Use `mapPartitions` instead of `groupBy` when possible     |
| **Coalesce**                     | Reducing the number of partitions                   | When the data has become sparse after a transformation  | ```scala val coalescedData = df.coalesce(1) ```            |
| **Predicate Pushdown**           | Filtering data as early as possible in the processing | To reduce the amount of data read and processed        | ```scala val filteredData = df.filter($"column" > 10) ```  |
| **Using the Right Join Strategy**| Choosing the most efficient way to join two datasets | Based on the size and distribution of data              | Prefer broadcast joins for small datasets                  |
| **Tuning Spark Configurations**  | Adjusting settings to optimize resource usage       | To match the workload and cluster resources             | ```scala spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "4g") ``` |
| **Using DataFrames/Datasets API**| Leveraging the high-level APIs for optimizations    | To benefit from Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten execution engine | ```scala val df = spark.read.csv("data.csv") df.groupBy("column").count() ``` |
| **Vectorized Query Execution**   | Processing multiple rows of data at a time          | For high-performance operations on large datasets       | Use built-in SQL functions and DataFrame methods           |

## Different phases of Spark-SQL engine

| **Phase**            | **Description**                                                        | **Details**                                                                                  | **Example**                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Parsing              | Converting SQL queries into a logical plan.                            | The SQL query is parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST).                                  | Converting `SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = 1` into an internal format. |
| Analysis             | Resolving references and verifying the logical plan.                   | Resolves column names, table names, and function names; checks for errors.                   | Ensuring that the table `table` and the column `id` exist in the database. |
| Optimization         | Improving the logical plan for better performance.                     | Transforms the logical plan using various optimization techniques; applies rules via Catalyst optimizer. | Reordering filters to reduce the amount of data processed early on. |
| Physical Planning    | Converting the logical plan into a physical plan.                      | Converts the optimized logical plan into one or more physical plans; selects the most efficient plan. | Deciding whether to use a hash join or a sort-merge join. |
| Code Generation      | Generating executable code from the physical plan.                     | Generates Java bytecode to execute the physical plan; this code runs on Spark executors.     | Creating code to perform join operations, filter data, and compute results. |
| Execution            | Running the generated code on the Spark cluster.                       | Distributes generated code across the Spark cluster; executed by Spark executors; results collected and returned. | Running join and filter operations on different nodes in the cluster and aggregating results. |
