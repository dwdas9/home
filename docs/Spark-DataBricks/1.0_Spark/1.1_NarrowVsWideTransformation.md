# Background
In Spark, transformations are classified into two types: **narrow** and **wide**.

## Narrow Transformations
- **Definition**: Each input partition contributes to only one output partition.
- **Example Operations**: `map()`, `filter()`, `select()`
- **Characteristics**:
  - No data shuffling across the network.
  - Fast and efficient.
  - Data can be processed in parallel without dependencies on other partitions.

<strong>Remember:</strong><br>
When we say "each input partition contributes to only one output partition," we mean that in a narrow transformation, the data from an input partition is processed and stored in exactly one corresponding output partition without the need to shuffle or move data between different partitions.

### Example
Consider a simple `filter()` operation that filters out rows based on some condition:

```python
# Assume we have an RDD with 4 partitions
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 4)

# Apply a filter transformation
filtered_rdd = rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
```

- **Input Partitions**: [ [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8] ]
- **Filter Condition**: Keep only even numbers

- **Output Partitions**:
  - Partition 1 (Input: [1, 2]) → Partition 1 (Output: [2])
  - Partition 2 (Input: [3, 4]) → Partition 2 (Output: [4])
  - Partition 3 (Input: [5, 6]) → Partition 3 (Output: [6])
  - Partition 4 (Input: [7, 8]) → Partition 4 (Output: [8])

Each input partition (e.g., [1, 2]) is processed and produces output that remains within the same partition (e.g., [2]). There is no data movement between partitions.



## Wide Transformations
- **Definition**: Each input partition contributes to multiple output partitions.
- **Example Operations**: `reduceByKey()`, `groupBy()`, `join()`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Data is shuffled across the network.
  - Slower compared to narrow transformations due to data movement.
  - Requires synchronization between partitions.

### Example
Now, consider a `reduceByKey()` operation which involves shuffling:

```python
# Assume we have an RDD with key-value pairs
rdd = sc.parallelize([(1, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (1, 4)], 2)

# Apply a reduceByKey transformation
reduced_rdd = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
```

- **Input Partitions**: [ [(1, 2), (3, 4)], [(3, 6), (1, 4)] ]

- **Reduce by Key**: Combine values with the same key

- **Output Partitions**:
  - Partition 1 (Input: [(1, 2), (1, 4)]) → Partition 1 (Output: [(1, 6)])
  - Partition 2 (Input: [(3, 4), (3, 6)]) → Partition 2 (Output: [(3, 10)])

In this case, keys with the same value (e.g., key = 1 or key = 3) need to be brought together into the same partition to perform the reduction. This requires shuffling data across the network, making it a wide transformation.


## Key Differences
**Data Movement:** Narrow transformations do not shuffle data, while wide transformations do.
**Performance:** Narrow transformations are faster and more efficient because there's no data movement.
**Parallelism:** Narrow transformations are easier to process in parallel, while wide transformations need to handle data dependencies and synchronization.
