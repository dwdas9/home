### Dictionaries are an Ordered Collection of Key-Value Pairs (Python 3.7 and Later)

Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of items. This means the order in which you add key-value pairs is preserved when you iterate over the dictionary.

### Let's look at examples

```python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "Wonderland"
}

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

# Iterating over the dictionary
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Output:
```
name Alice
age 30
city Wonderland
email alice@example.com
```

In this example, the order of key-value pairs is the same as the order in which they were added to the dictionary.
