### Using `pdb` for Debugging

Debugging is an important part of writing code, and Python has a built-in tool called `pdb` to help with this.

#### What is `pdb`?

`pdb` is Python's interactive debugger. It lets you pause your code, inspect variables, and step through the code line by line to find out what's going wrong.

#### Setting Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow you to pause your code at specific points to see what's happening at that moment.

**Example:**

In your Python script, you can set a breakpoint like this:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)
```

When you run this script, it will pause before returning the result, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.

#### Stepping Through Code

`pdb` lets you execute your code line by line to see what happens at each step.

**Example:**

Using the same script, once `pdb` pauses execution, you can step through the code.

```bash
(pdb) n  # 'n' is for next line
(pdb) p a  # 'p' is for print
2
(pdb) p b
3
(pdb) c  # 'c' is for continue
```

#### Inspecting and Modifying Variables

You can check and change the values of variables at any point during execution.

**Example:**

While debugging, you might find the value of `a` is not as expected. You can modify it.

```bash
(pdb) p a
2
(pdb) a = 5
(pdb) p a
5
```

#### Evaluating Expressions

`pdb` lets you run Python expressions interactively, so you can test code snippets in real-time.

**Example:**

```bash
(pdb) p a + b
8
```

#### Why Use `pdb`?

Using `pdb` gives you a deeper understanding of your code's execution flow compared to just using `print` statements. Instead of scattering `print` statements throughout your code, you can use `pdb` to explore and diagnose issues interactively. This makes debugging more efficient and helps you find the root cause of problems more effectively.
