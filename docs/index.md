# Welcome to Das Digital Digest

Hello! I am Das and welcome to my page. Here I share my work and learnings as a Data Engineer and AI enthusiast. Most things come from daily work and real projects, not heavy theory. My idea is to keep it simple, practical, and easy to follow.

## About Me



!!! Quote "Early Life"

    I was born in West Bengal, India. When I was just a few months old, my father’s transferable job took us to many places in India and South East Asia. I studied in different Army schools across India. During the last semester of my master’s, I was hired by HCL Technologies and seconded to Singapore after my internship. Since then, I’ve moved between Singapore, Amsterdam, and Canada, often returning to Singapore as my wife (then girlfriend) was studying there, including her PhD and postdocs. Today, we live in Singapore with our daughter, and my wife works as a scientist/Senior Assistant Director in a public sector R&D agency.

!!! Example "Education"

    I have a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Calcutta, and a Master’s in Computer Application from West Bengal University of Technology.


!!! Abstract "Professional Journey"

    I started my career as a final-year intern at [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/), working on .NET and MSSQL. After my internship, I was seconded to Singapore. Since 2007, I have worked across Singapore, Canada, and Amsterdam on Data and ECM projects, mainly on Microsoft platforms. Since 2017, I worked mainly on Azure and Government Cloud migration projects. I currently work as Senior Manager/Data Engineer at IRAS (Ministry of Finance, Singapore), supporting data migration to Azure Government Commercial Cloud (GCC). Over the years, I have gained experience in both services and product companies, across government and private sectors.

    === "Background"  
        **Background:**  
        This project was for a leading multinational bank with its operations hub in Singapore and branches across Southeast Asia. The bank wanted to roll out a Digital Capture and Analytics solution to streamline manual, paper-heavy processes in areas like account opening, credit cards, investments, and loans. While the design and development were centralized in Singapore, each country had to run localized workflows and store data onshore to comply with strict residency and regulatory requirements.

    === "SSIS ETL Solution Architecture"
        **SSIS Design Decision Rationale:**
        
        The decision to implement SSIS 2005/2008 as the ETL backbone (instead of direct Captiva-SQL integration) was driven by:
        
        - **Existing SSIS Investment**: Bank had substantial investment in Microsoft SQL Server ecosystem and SSIS expertise
        - **Tight Integration**: Native integration with SQL Server databases and existing data warehouse infrastructure
        - **Security & Connectivity**: Avoided additional security overhead and complex connectivity requirements of direct Captiva-DB integration
        - **Scalability**: SSIS provided better horizontal scaling capabilities for high-volume document processing
        - **Monitoring & Management**: Leveraged existing SQL Server monitoring and management tools
        - **Cost Effectiveness**: Reduced licensing costs compared to additional Captiva modules

        **Business-Specific ETL Implementation:**

        **1. Account Opening ETL Package:**
        ```sql
        -- SSIS Package Variables & Configuration
        @XMLFilePath VARCHAR(500) = '\\NetworkShare\XMLExport\AccountOpening\*.xml'
        @ProcessingDate DATETIME = GETDATE()
        @BatchID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER = NEWID()
        @ErrorThreshold INT = 5  -- Maximum allowed errors per batch
        
        -- Control Flow Logic
        EXEC [dbo].[sp_StartETLProcess] 
            @PackageName = 'AccountOpeningETL',
            @BatchID = @BatchID,
            @ProcessingDate = @ProcessingDate
        ```

        **Data Flow Transformations:**
        - **XML Source**: Parse account opening XML with dynamic schema detection
        - **Data Conversion**: Convert customer data types (ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses)
        - **Lookup Transformations**:
          - Country code validation
          - Branch code verification
          - Product code mapping
          - Currency standardization
        - **Derived Column**: Calculate fields like account opening age, risk category, relationship value
        - **Conditional Split**: Route based on account types (savings, current, fixed deposit)

        **2. Credit Card ETL Package:**
        ```csharp
        // Business Rules Implementation (C# Script Component)
        public override void ProcessInputRow(ComponentInputRow Row)
        {
            // Credit Score Risk Categorization
            if (Row.CreditScore >= 750 && Row.AnnualIncome >= 100000)
                Row.RiskCategory = "PREMIUM";
            else if (Row.CreditScore >= 650 && Row.AnnualIncome >= 50000)
                Row.RiskCategory = "STANDARD";
            else
                Row.RiskCategory = "SUBPRIME";
            
            // Card Limit Calculation
            Row.RecommendedLimit = Math.Min(Row.AnnualIncome * 0.25, 
                                           GetMaxLimitByCategory(Row.RiskCategory));
            
            // Data Residency Compliance Check
            Row.DataResidencyCompliant = (Row.CustomerCountry == Row.ProcessingCountry) ? 1 : 0;
            
            // Audit Trail
            Row.ProcessedDateTime = DateTime.Now;
            Row.ProcessedBy = Variables.SSISPackageName;
            Row.BatchID = Variables.BatchID;
        }
        ```

        **3. Investment Product ETL Package:**
        
        **Complex XML Parsing for Nested Investment Data:**
        ```xml
        <!-- Sample Investment XML Structure -->
        <InvestmentApplication>
            <CustomerDetails>
                <CustomerID>CU001234567</CustomerID>
                <RiskProfile>MODERATE</RiskProfile>
                <InvestmentExperience>5</InvestmentExperience>
            </CustomerDetails>
            <PortfolioAllocation>
                <AssetClass Type="Equity" Percentage="60" Amount="100000" />
                <AssetClass Type="Bonds" Percentage="30" Amount="50000" />
                <AssetClass Type="Cash" Percentage="10" Amount="16667" />
            </PortfolioAllocation>

        **Advanced Error Handling & Recovery Framework:**
        ```sql
        -- SSIS Error Handling Stored Procedure
        CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_HandleETLErrors]
            @PackageName VARCHAR(100),
            @BatchID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER,
            @ErrorCode INT,
            @ErrorDescription VARCHAR(MAX),
            @SourceRow XML
        AS
        BEGIN
            -- Log error details
            INSERT INTO [ETL].[ErrorLog] 
            VALUES (@PackageName, @BatchID, @ErrorCode, @ErrorDescription, @SourceRow, GETDATE())
            
            -- Check if error threshold exceeded
            IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [ETL].[ErrorLog] 
                WHERE BatchID = @BatchID AND PackageName = @PackageName) > @ErrorThreshold
            BEGIN
                -- Stop package execution and send notification
                EXEC [dbo].[sp_SendETLErrorNotification] @PackageName, @BatchID
                RETURN -1  -- Fail the package
            END
            
            -- Automatic retry for transient errors
            IF @ErrorCode IN (2, 4, 8)  -- Connection, timeout, deadlock errors
            BEGIN
                EXEC [dbo].[sp_ScheduleETLRetry] @PackageName, @BatchID, 300  -- Retry in 5 minutes
            END
        END
        ```

        **Performance Optimization Strategies:**

        **1. Parallel Processing Implementation:**
        - **MaxConcurrentExecutables**: Set to number of CPU cores for optimal parallel execution
        - **Partition Processing**: Split large XML files into smaller chunks for parallel processing
        - **Asynchronous Components**: Use asynchronous transformations for CPU-intensive operations

        **2. Memory Management:**
        ```sql
        -- SSIS Package Configuration
        BufferTempStoragePath = "E:\SSIS\TempBuffers"  -- Fast SSD storage
        DefaultBufferMaxRows = 10000                   -- Optimized for memory usage
        DefaultBufferSize = 10485760                   -- 10MB buffer size
        MaxBuffersPerInput = 100                       -- Memory-dependent setting
        ```

        **3. Database Loading Optimization:**
        - **Bulk Insert**: Use OLE DB Destination with bulk loading enabled
        - **Table Locking**: Implement table-level locking during loading for better performance
        - **Index Management**: Drop non-clustered indexes during loading, rebuild after completion
        - **Statistics Update**: Automatic statistics update post data loading

        **Monitoring & Alerting Framework:**
        ```sql
        -- ETL Process Monitoring Dashboard Query
        SELECT 
            p.PackageName,
            p.ExecutionStartTime,
            p.ExecutionEndTime,
            DATEDIFF(MINUTE, p.ExecutionStartTime, p.ExecutionEndTime) AS DurationMinutes,
            p.RowsProcessed,
            p.RowsInserted,
            p.RowsUpdated,
            p.RowsRejected,
            CASE 
                WHEN p.RowsRejected > (p.RowsProcessed * 0.01) THEN 'HIGH ERROR RATE'
                WHEN DATEDIFF(MINUTE, p.ExecutionStartTime, p.ExecutionEndTime) > p.ExpectedDurationMinutes * 1.5 THEN 'PERFORMANCE ISSUE'
                ELSE 'NORMAL'
            END AS Status
        FROM [ETL].[PackageExecutionLog] p
        WHERE p.ExecutionDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE())
        ORDER BY p.ExecutionStartTime DESC
