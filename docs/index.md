# Welcome to Das Digital Digest

Hello! I am Das and welcome to my page. Here I share my work and learnings as a Data Engineer and AI enthusiast. Most things come from daily work and real projects, not heavy theory. My idea is to keep it simple, practical, and easy to follow.

## About Me



!!! Quote "Early Life"

    I was born in West Bengal, India. When I was just a few months old, my father’s transferable job took us to many places in India and South East Asia. I studied in different Army schools across India. During the last semester of my master’s, I was hired by HCL Technologies and seconded to Singapore after my internship. Since then, I’ve moved between Singapore, Amsterdam, and Canada, often returning to Singapore as my wife (then girlfriend) was studying there, including her PhD and postdocs. Today, we live in Singapore with our daughter, and my wife works as a scientist/Senior Assistant Director in a public sector R&D agency.

!!! Example "Education"

    I have a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Calcutta, and a Master’s in Computer Application from West Bengal University of Technology.


!!! Abstract "Professional Journey"

    I started my career as a final-year intern at [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/), working on .NET and MSSQL. After my internship, I was seconded to Singapore. Since 2007, I have worked across Singapore, Canada, and Amsterdam on Data and ECM projects, mainly on Microsoft platforms. Since 2017, I worked mainly on Azure and Government Cloud migration projects. I currently work as Senior Manager/Data Engineer at IRAS (Ministry of Finance, Singapore), supporting data migration to Azure Government Commercial Cloud (GCC). Over the years, I have gained experience in both services and product companies, across government and private sectors.

??? tabs "SSIS-based ETL Solution For a Multinational Bank"

    === "Project Overview"
        **Background**

        This project was for a leading multinational bank with its hub in Singapore and branches across Southeast Asia. The goal was to build an ETL framework to process structured XML data from the bank’s document capture platform and integrate it with their existing SQL Server systems. SSIS was chosen as the ETL tool since it was already part of the SQL Server stack and required minimal changes to security or infrastructure.

        **Project Details:**  
        - **Role:** Solution Architect / Onsite coordinator
        - **Duration:** October 2014 – December 2016  
        - **Team Size:** 12 members (ETL developers, database architects, business analysts, DBAs)  
        - **Domain:** Banking & Financial Services - Document Processing
        - **Pilot Scope:** Credit Card Applications & Account Opening (with expansion roadmap)

        **Responsibilities**
        In this project, I worked as a solution architect and onsite coordinator, focusing on the design and development of the ETL framework. My role covered selecting the right SQL Server–based tools, designing the core data integration approach, and building key SSIS workflows. I collaborated with business analysts to turn requirements into technical specifications, ensured data quality checks were in place, and tuned performance for high-volume processing. Alongside my own development work, I supported the offshore team by reviewing packages and providing technical guidance where needed.

        **Data Quality**
        We built in basic data quality checks at the ETL stage:
            - XML schema validation (XSD)
            - Business rule checks (credit scoring, risk, compliance)
            - Required field and format validation
            - Reference data lookups (country codes, branch codes, products)
            - Audit trail to track records end-to-end

        **Performance Tuning**
        To handle large volumes, we tuned SSIS for speed:
            - Ran packages in parallel where servers allowed
            - Used bulk loading (OLE DB with batch commits)
            - Adjusted buffer sizes and row limits for available memory
            - Disabled/rebuilt indexes during heavy loads
            - Reused database connections to reduce overhead

??? tabs "SSIS-based ETL Solution Architecture – Major Oil & Gas Company"
    === "Project Overview"
        **Background:**

        This project was for a major oil & gas company. Their existing data capture system produced XML files—mainly invoices and contracts—from multiple countries (Angola, Egypt, ANZ, Iberia, Germany). I built an ETL in SSIS to extract, validate, and transform the XML, then load it into SQL Server for downstream consumers, including SAP and BI/reporting teams. SSIS was chosen because it was already in place, integrated with MSSQL and downstream systems, and required minimal changes to existing security and network setups.

        **Implementation Approach:**

        After gathering requirements, the XML schemas for invoices, contracts, and related documents were analyzed. The ETL was built in SSIS with reusable packages for parsing, validation, and staging. Custom C# libraries were used for handling complex XML structures, applying business rules, and data enrichment. A staging database managed raw data, and audit, monitoring, and alerting were implemented to track processing and handle errors. The processed data was then loaded into SQL Server for downstream systems including SAP.

        **Business Value:**

        During the initial phase, the solution automated processing of ~10k XML files per month with error handling and recovery. It provided clean, structured data for SAP and reporting teams, supported 24/7 processing with high availability, and was built on a reusable ETL framework that scaled with growing data volumes.

??? tabs "SharePoint 2007 – Farm Infrastructure Design & Migration"
    === "Project Overview"
        **Background:**

        This project involved migrating a standalone SharePoint 2007 deployment to a 6-server farm for a logistics and supply chain company in Amsterdam. I designed the farm with redundancy and load balancing, set up SQL Server 2008 R2 Active/Passive failover clusters, and implemented the necessary network and load balancing infrastructure. Around 50 site collections were migrated with minimal downtime, and governance, security, and operational procedures were established.


        **Implementation Approach**

        The project involved migrating a standalone SharePoint 2007 deployment to a 6-server farm. The work started with planning and architecture design, including stakeholder workshops, analyzing the existing environment, defining growth requirements, and creating hardware and procurement plans. SQL Server 2008 R2 failover clusters were implemented with shared storage, backup, and recovery procedures, coordinating with networking and infrastructure teams. The SharePoint farm was deployed across multiple servers, with service applications distributed, F5 load balancer configured, and business requirements integrated. Site collections were migrated in phases using stsadm, with end-user validation, monitoring, and performance tracking. Operational procedures, monitoring dashboards, and alerting frameworks were established, and the production cutover was executed with infrastructure and business teams.

??? tabs "SharePoint 2007 – Publishing Portal Content Transformation"
    === "Background"  
        **Background:**  
        For a major Insurance provider, legacy intranet content was hosted on **static HTML/ASP sites** and dispersed repositories, resulting in:
        - Manual content updates  
        - Limited search capabilities  
        - No multilingual support  
        - Decentralized document and asset management  

        The client wanted to migrate to **Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 Publishing Portal** to establish centralized content storage, structured publishing, multilingual support, and enterprise search capabilities.
