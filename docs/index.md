# Welcome to Das Digital Digest

Welcome to my personal website, where I share insights and experiences from my journey in data engineering, cloud migration, and technology. Here, you'll find detailed accounts of projects I've worked on, the challenges I've faced, and the solutions I've implemented.

!!! Quote "About Me"

    I was born in West Bengal. My father served in the armed forces, and my mother is a homemaker. Because of my father’s transferable job, I grew up across different parts of India, attending army schools along the way.

    For higher education, I moved to Kolkata, where I completed a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/)  and a Master’s in Computer Application from the [West Bengal University of Technology](https://makautwb.ac.in/).

    In 2007, I relocated to Singapore. That same year, I met my wife, and we married in 2016. We have a daughter. My wife holds a bachelor’s and master’s in biotechnology from [St. Xavier’s College](https://www.sxccal.edu/), and a PhD and postdoctoral fellowship from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). She currently works as a Senior Scientist and Senior Assistant Director at [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/).

    My professional journey began as a final-year intern at [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/), where I worked on .NET and MSSQL. I was later seconded to Singapore, which marked the start of my international career. Over the years, I have worked across Singapore, Canada, and Amsterdam on Data and ECM projects, primarily on Microsoft platforms.

    I currently serve as Senior Manager and Data Engineer at [IRAS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/) (Ministry of Finance, Singapore), supporting data migration to the Azure Government Commercial Cloud (GCC). My experience spans both service and product companies across government and private sectors, involving end-to-end technology implementation and cloud adoption.
