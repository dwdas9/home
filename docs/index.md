# Welcome to Das Digital Digest

Hello! I am Das and welcome to my page. Here I share my work and learnings as a Data Engineer and AI enthusiast. Most things come from daily work and real projects, not heavy theory. My idea is to keep it simple, practical, and easy to follow.

## About Me

## Early Life

I was born in West Bengal, India. When I was just a few months old, my father’s transferable job took us to many places in India and South East Asia. I studied in different Army schools across India. During the last semester of my master’s, I was hired by HCL Technologies and seconded to Singapore after my internship. Since then, I’ve moved between Singapore, Amsterdam, and Canada, often returning to Singapore as my wife (then girlfriend) was studying there, including her PhD and postdocs. Today, we live in Singapore with our daughter, and my wife works as a scientist/Senior Assistant Director in a public sector R&D agency.

## Education

I have a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Calcutta, and a Master’s in Computer Application from West Bengal University of Technology.


## Professional Journey

I started my career as a final-year intern at [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/), working on .NET and MSSQL. After my internship, I was seconded to Singapore. Since 2007, I have worked across Singapore, Canada, and Amsterdam on Data and ECM projects, mainly on Microsoft platforms. Since 2017, I worked mainly on Azure and Government Cloud migration projects. I currently work as Senior Manager/Data Engineer at IRAS (Ministry of Finance, Singapore), supporting data migration to Azure Government Commercial Cloud (GCC). Over the years, I have gained experience in both services and product companies, across government and private sectors.
