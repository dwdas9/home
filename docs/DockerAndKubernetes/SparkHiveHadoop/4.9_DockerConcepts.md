# Understanding Dockerfile CMD and ENTRYPOINT Instructions

CMD and ENTRYPOINT are important Dockerfile instructions that define what command runs when a Docker container starts. Here, I will try to explain the concepts:
## What is ENTRYPOINT?

ENTRYPOINT sets the main process that will run inside the container. For example:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/my-app"]
```
In this case, `/usr/bin/my-app` is the process that will run when the container starts.

## What is CMD?

CMD specifies the default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT process. For instance:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/my-app"]
CMD ["help"]
```
Here, `help` is passed as an argument to `/usr/bin/my-app`.

## Key Differences Between ENTRYPOINT and CMD

- **ENTRYPOINT**: Defines the main process to run in the container.
- **CMD**: Provides default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT process.
- **Override**:
  - CMD can be easily overridden by passing arguments in the `docker run` command.
  - ENTRYPOINT can be changed using the `--entrypoint` flag in `docker run`, but this is rarely necessary.

# Docker PS Error
## For Our Windows Users:

1. **Verify Docker's Installation Path:** 
   - Navigate to `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin` via your command prompt or PowerShell. 
   - While you're there, try running `docker ps`. If it responds, you're in luck! If not, let's move to the next step.

2. **Update the System PATH:** 
   - Sometimes, Windows isn't aware of where Docker is. We'll need to tell it.
   - Open 'System Properties' by right-clicking on the Windows start button and selecting 'System'.
   - Click on 'Advanced system settings', then choose 'Environment Variables'.
   - Locate the PATH variable under 'System Variables'. Click on it and then select 'Edit'.
   - Add a new entry with the path: `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin`.
   - Confirm with 'OK'.

3. **Using PowerShell to Update the PATH:** 
   - If you're a fan of PowerShell, you can also add the path using the following command:
     ```powershell
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin", "Machine")
     ```
4. **Check** if its running now. Just open command prompt and run `docker ps`. You should get some output. For example:

![Alt text](images/runningdockerps.png)


## For Our Mac Users:

1. **Verify Docker's Installation:** 
   - Open your terminal and type in `docker --version`. This ensures that Docker is installed.
   
2. **Is Docker Running?** 
   - Check if the Docker Desktop application is running. If it's not, fire it up!

3. **Update the Shell's PATH:** 
   - Sometimes, the shell doesn’t know where Docker is located. To fix this:
     ```bash
     echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

4. **Final Check:** 
   - Close and reopen your terminal, then try `docker ps`. If all's well, it should work!

# Backup entire docker to your laptop
## Save Docker Containers, Images, and Volumes on Mac/Linux

To back up Docker containers, images, and volumes on Mac/Linux, you can use the following script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create directories to store backups
mkdir -p docker_image_backups docker_container_backups docker_volume_backups

# Backup Docker images
for image in $(docker images --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}"); do
  sanitized_image_name=$(echo $image | tr / _)
  docker save -o docker_image_backups/${sanitized_image_name}.tar $image
done

# Backup Docker containers
for container in $(docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}"); do
  docker export -o docker_container_backups/${container}.tar $container
done

# Backup Docker volumes
for volume in $(docker volume ls --format "{{.Name}}"); do
  docker run --rm -v ${volume}:/volume -v $(pwd)/docker_volume_backups:/backup alpine sh -c "cd /volume && tar czf /backup/${volume}.tar.gz ."
done

# Create a single tarball containing all backups
tar czf docker_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz docker_image_backups docker_container_backups docker_volume_backups

echo "Backup completed successfully!"
```

To run the script:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `backup_docker.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x backup_docker.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```sh
   ./backup_docker.sh
   ```

This will create a full backup of all Docker images, containers, and volumes.

## Save Docker Containers, Images, and Volumes on Windows

To back up Docker containers, images, and volumes on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder and save the following content as `backup_docker.ps1`:

    ```powershell
    # Backup Docker Images
    docker images -q | ForEach-Object { docker save -o "$($_).tar" $_ }

    # Backup Running Containers
    docker ps -q | ForEach-Object { docker export -o "$($_).tar" $_ }

    # Backup Docker Volumes
    $volumes = docker volume ls -q
    foreach ($volume in $volumes) {
        docker run --rm -v ${volume}:/volume -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/${volume}_backup.tar /volume
    }

    # Backup Docker Configurations
    Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\your\docker\configurations" -Destination "C:\path\to\your\backup\location" -Recurse
    ```

2. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and navigate to the folder you created:

    ```powershell
    cd path\to\your\folder
    ```

3. Set the execution policy to allow the script to run temporarily:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```powershell
    .\backup_docker.ps1
    ```

This way you can back up all your Docker containers, images, and volumes to the current folder.

# <span style="color: blueviolet;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Orchestration Tools - Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes</span>

To manage complex applications, many developers use containers. Containers package all the necessary dependencies, making applications portable, fast, secure, scalable, and easy to manage. To handle multiple containers, you need an orchestration tool like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

Both tools manage containers but have different strengths and weaknesses. This article will help you decide which one is right for you.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Docker Swarm</span>

Docker Swarm, an open-source orchestration tool by Docker, turns multiple Docker instances into a single virtual host. Here are its key components:

| Component            | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Nodes                | Individual Docker instances.               |
| Services and Tasks   | The applications you run.                  |
| Load Balancers       | Distribute requests across nodes.          |

**Advantages of Docker Swarm:**
- **Ease of Use:** Simple installation and understanding.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Docker CLI.
- **Automated Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic within the cluster automatically.

**Disadvantages of Docker Swarm:**
- **Limited Functionality:** Less powerful compared to Kubernetes.
- **Basic Automation:** Not as robust as Kubernetes.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Kubernetes</span>

Kubernetes, developed by Google, offers a more complex structure with nodes, pods, namespaces, and more.

| Component            | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Nodes                | Worker machines in the cluster.            |
| Pods                 | Smallest deployable units, containing one or more containers. |
| Namespaces           | Logical isolation for resources.           |

**Advantages of Kubernetes:**
- **Community Support:** Backed by Google, with a large open-source community.
- **Operating System Support:** Works on all OS.
- **Scalability and Management:** Handles large and complex workloads.
- **Automation and Self-Healing:** Automatically scales and repairs itself.
- **Built-in Monitoring:** Includes monitoring tools.
- **Cloud Support:** Available on Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS.

**Disadvantages of Kubernetes:**
- **Complexity:** Difficult to install and learn.
- **Separate Tools:** Requires learning new CLI tools.
- **Transition:** Moving from Docker Swarm can be challenging.
- **Overhead:** Can be overly complex for simple applications.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Comparing Docker Swarm and Kubernetes</span>

| Aspect               | Docker Swarm                               | Kubernetes                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Installation         | Easy to install and use. Works with Docker CLI. | Complex installation, separate CLI tools. |
| Application Deployment | YAML or Docker Compose for services or microservices. | More options like namespaces, pods, and deployments. |
| Availability and Scaling | High availability, but no automatic scaling. | Highly available, fault-tolerant, self-healing, and automatic scaling. |
| Monitoring           | Requires third-party tools.                | Built-in monitoring and third-party integrations. |
| Security             | Uses TLS for security.                     | Supports multiple security protocols (RBAC, SSL/TLS, secrets management). |
| Load Balancing       | Automatic load balancing using DNS.        | Uses tools like Nginx Ingress for load balancing. |

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">K3s, best of both worlds</span>

[K3s](https://k3s.io/), a lightweight version of Kubernetes. It gives you the full Kubernetes API without complexity. It's easy to use and CNCF certified. Consider K3s if you want Kubernetes features with simpler management.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Which One Should You Choose?</span>

- **Docker Swarm:** Best for beginners and small-scale applications due to its ease of use.
- **Kubernetes:** Ideal for complex and large-scale projects requiring robust features and automation.
- **K3s:** Suitable if you want Kubernetes features with less complexity.

# <span style="color: blueviolet;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Running Windows OS as a Container in Docker</span>

When you think of containers, you usually picture a small Linux OS. And you’re right! But did you know that containers can run a small Windows OS too?

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Switching Docker Desktop to Windows Mode</span>

For most of your tasks, you've likely been using Docker containers, which are typically Linux-based. Running a Windows container might seem unusual. By default, Docker on your Windows machine operates in 'Linux mode.' To run Windows containers, you'll need to switch from this default Linux mode to Windows mode.

And you can switch back to Linux containers easily.

**Note:** When you switch to Windows mode, you won’t be able to see your Linux containers.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Switching Using Command Line</span>

You can also switch using the command line:

```powershell
& $Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe -SwitchDaemon
```

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Microsoft Base Images</span>

Microsoft offers several base images to start building your own container images:

- **Windows**: Contains the full set of Windows APIs and system services (excluding server roles).
- **Windows Server**: Contains the full set of Windows APIs and system services.
- **Windows Server Core**: A smaller image with a subset of Windows Server APIs, including the full .NET framework and most server roles (excluding some like Fax Server).
- **Nano Server**: The smallest Windows Server image, supporting .NET Core APIs and some server roles.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Ready-Made Bundles</span>

Microsoft offers ready-made bundles that combine Windows Server 2022 with apps like MongoDB.

For example, if you need MongoDB on Windows Server 2022, you can use this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/main/windows-container-samples/mongodb).

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Other Combinations</span>

Other combinations you can create include:

- aspnet
- iis
- Django
- apache-http-php
- nginx
- dotnet35
- golang
- nodejs
- python
- python-django
- rails
- ruby
- server-jre-8u51-windows-x64
- mongodb
- mysql
- redis
- sqlite
- sqlserver-express
- PowerShellDSC_iis-10.0

Now you know that containers are not just small Linux OSs. They can be a mini Windows OS too!

# <span style="color: blueviolet;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Types of Kubernetes</span>

Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications, but there are many ways to set it up based on your needs. The table below summriazes the various available kubernetes 'brands':

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">For the busy people:</span>
- **Development**: **Minikube**, **K3d**, **Docker Desktop Kubernetes**, and **Kind** are geared toward development and testing.
- **Production**: **Kubeadm**, **Rancher**, **K3s**, and managed services like **Amazon EKS**, **Google GKE**, and **Azure AKS** are suited for production environments.
- **Mixed Use**: **K3s** and **MicroK8s** can be used both in development and production, especially in edge computing and IoT.

## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Kubernetes Brands<span>

# How I push customized Images to Docker Hub(Website)

Recently, I set up a Kafka environment using the base images from Confluent. After tweaking and customizing these images to fit my specific needs, I realized that these modified images should be pushed to Docker Hub so I can easily reuse them later or share them with others. I had 9 images in total, so here’s the process I followed.

### Step 1: Log In to Docker Hub

The first thing I did was log in to Docker Hub using my Docker Hub username, `dwdas9`.

```bash
docker login
```

It asked for my Docker Hub username and password, and once I provided those, I was logged in.

### Step 2: Find the Image Names

To push the images, I needed to know their names. I used the following command to list all the Docker images on my local machine:

```bash
docker images
```

This command gave me a list of all the images, including their names, tags, and IDs. I picked out the relevant images that I had customized.

### Step 3: Tag the Images

Before I could push the images, I had to tag them with my Docker Hub username and the repository name I wanted them to go into. Here’s how I did it for each of the 9 images:

```bash
docker tag confluentinc/cp-ksqldb-server:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-ksqldb-server:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-kafka-rest:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-kafka-rest:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-schema-registry:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-enterprise-control-center:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-enterprise-control-center:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect-base:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-kafka-connect-base:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-server:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-server:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-zookeeper:v6
docker tag confluentinc/ksqldb-examples:6.0.1 dwdas9/ksqldb-examples:v6
docker tag confluentinc/cp-ksqldb-cli:6.0.1 dwdas9/cp-ksqldb-cli:v6
```

I replaced `confluentinc` with my username `dwdas9` and added a custom tag `v6` to each image.

### Step 4: Push the Images to Docker Hub

With the images tagged, the next step was to push them to Docker Hub. I ran the following commands:

```bash
docker push dwdas9/cp-ksqldb-server:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-kafka-rest:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-schema-registry:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-enterprise-control-center:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-kafka-connect-base:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-server:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-zookeeper:v6
docker push dwdas9/ksqldb-examples:v6
docker push dwdas9/cp-ksqldb-cli:v6
```

Docker started uploading each image to the repository. Once the upload was complete, I could see all my modified images on Docker Hub under my account.

### Conclusion

And that’s it! Now, my customized Kafka environment images are safely stored on Docker Hub, ready to be pulled down whenever I need them. If you’re working on something similar, these steps should help you push your images too.

# Troubleshooting docker errors

If your Docker container is showing up as orange (in Docker Desktop) or failed to start without giving specific details, it means the container likely encountered an error during startup. Docker doesn’t always show detailed error messages in the UI, but you can retrieve more information using the following methods.

## Steps to Debug the Issue

### 1. **Check the Container Logs**

You can check the logs for the failed container to see what went wrong. Run this command to inspect the container logs:

```bash
docker logs your-container-name
```

This will show you any errors or issues that occurred during the container’s initialization. Look for specific errors related to:
- Missing environment variables.
- Errors in Spark or system configuration.
- Issues with file mounting (e.g., mapping the `conf` directory).

### 2. **Inspect the Container Status**

You can inspect the container to get more information about why it failed. Use the `docker inspect` command:

```bash
docker inspect your-container-name
```

This will provide detailed information about the container's configuration, including the exit code. Look for anything abnormal in the output, especially the `State` and `ExitCode` sections.

### 3. **Check for File Permissions and Volume Issues**

Sometimes, volume mapping can cause issues, especially when the local directory being mounted doesn’t have the correct permissions, or Docker has trouble accessing it.

Make sure that the local `mapped-folder` folder has the correct permissions for Docker to access it. For example:

- Check if the directory exists and has read/write permissions:

```bash
ls -ld mapped-folder
```

If the directory is not accessible by Docker, try giving it the correct permissions:

```bash
chmod -R 755 mapped-folder
```
