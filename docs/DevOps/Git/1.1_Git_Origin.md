# Understanding Git Origin

You clone a repo. You type `git push origin main`. You see `origin` everywhere. What is it?

It's just a name. A shortcut. A reference to the remote repository on GitHub or GitLab or wherever your code lives.

## What Origin Is

When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin`. It points to the URL you cloned from.

Think of it as a bookmark. Instead of typing the full URL every time, you just say `origin`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Your Computer] -->|origin points to| B[GitHub Repository]
    
    style A fill:#e8f5e9
    style B fill:#e1f5ff
```

That's it. `origin` is just a name for the remote location of your code.

## The Basic Commands

This is what you'll use every day:

```bash
# Check what origin points to
git remote -v
```

Output:

```
origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (push)
```

Two lines. One for fetching. One for pushing. Both point to the same place.

**Common operations:**

```bash
# Fetch from origin
git fetch origin

# Pull from origin's main branch
git pull origin main

# Push to origin's main branch
git push origin main
```

You're using `origin` instead of typing the full URL. That's all it is.

## How Origin Gets Created

You clone a repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

Git automatically does this behind the scenes:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

You didn't have to set it up. Git did it for you.

Check it:

```bash
git remote -v
```

There it is. `origin` pointing to your repo.

## Is Origin Special?

No. It's just a convention.

You could name it anything:

```bash
git remote add pizza https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push pizza main
```

That works. But everyone uses `origin`. It's the standard. Don't be different just to be different.

!!! tip "Stick with Convention"
    Use `origin` for your primary remote. Your team expects it. Tools assume it. Don't fight convention.

## Quick Command Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| See all remotes | `git remote -v` |
| Add a remote named origin | `git remote add origin <url>` |
| Change origin URL | `git remote set-url origin <new-url>` |
| Remove origin | `git remote remove origin` |
| Rename origin | `git remote rename origin old-origin` |
| Fetch from origin | `git fetch origin` |
| Push to origin | `git push origin <branch>` |
| Pull from origin | `git pull origin <branch>` |

## Advanced Scenarios

Everything below is optional. But useful for complex setups.

### Working with Multiple Remotes

??? example "Origin vs Upstream (Forked Repositories)"
    
    You forked a repository. You have two remotes:
    
    - `origin` → Your fork on GitHub
    - `upstream` → The original repository
    
    **Why two remotes?**
    
    You push to your fork (`origin`). You pull from the original repo (`upstream`) to stay up to date.
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TB
        A[Original Repo] -->|You forked it| B[Your Fork]
        B -->|git clone| C[Your Computer]
        C -->|git push| B
        A -->|git fetch upstream| C
        
        style A fill:#fff3e0
        style B fill:#e1f5ff
        style C fill:#e8f5e9
    ```
    
    **Setup:**
    
    ```bash
    # Clone your fork (origin is created automatically)
    git clone https://github.com/you/repo.git
    
    # Add upstream
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git
    ```
    
    **Check your remotes:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    origin    https://github.com/you/repo.git (fetch)
    origin    https://github.com/you/repo.git (push)
    upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git (fetch)
    upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git (push)
    ```
    
    **Daily workflow:**
    
    ```bash
    # Fetch latest from original repo
    git fetch upstream
    
    # Update your local main
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    
    # Push to your fork
    git push origin main
    ```

### Changing the Origin URL

??? tip "Switching from HTTPS to SSH (or Vice Versa)"
    
    You cloned with HTTPS. Now you want SSH. Or the repo moved. Or you got the URL wrong.
    
    **Check current URL:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (push)
    ```
    
    **Change to SSH:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
    ```
    
    **Verify:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    origin  git@github.com:username/repo.git (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:username/repo.git (push)
    ```
    
    Done. No need to re-clone.

### Adding Origin to an Existing Local Repo

??? example "When You Init Locally First"
    
    You created a repo on your machine:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project
    git init
    ```
    
    You made commits. Now you want to push to GitHub.
    
    **Create repo on GitHub** (don't initialize with README).
    
    **Add origin:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-project.git
    ```
    
    **Push your code:**
    
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    
    Your local repo is now connected to GitHub.

### Working with Multiple Origins

??? abstract "Deploy to Different Servers"
    
    You have one codebase. Multiple deployment targets.
    
    - `origin` → GitHub for version control
    - `production` → Production server
    - `staging` → Staging server
    
    **Add multiple remotes:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
    git remote add production user@prod-server:/var/www/repo.git
    git remote add staging user@staging-server:/var/www/repo.git
    ```
    
    **Check all remotes:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    origin      https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
    origin      https://github.com/username/repo.git (push)
    production  user@prod-server:/var/www/repo.git (fetch)
    production  user@prod-server:/var/www/repo.git (push)
    staging     user@staging-server:/var/www/repo.git (fetch)
    staging     user@staging-server:/var/www/repo.git (push)
    ```
    
    **Push to specific remote:**
    
    ```bash
    # Push to GitHub
    git push origin main
    
    # Deploy to staging
    git push staging main
    
    # Deploy to production
    git push production main
    ```

### Removing and Re-adding Origin

??? warning "Fixing a Messed Up Remote"
    
    Your origin is broken. Wrong URL. Corrupted. Whatever.
    
    **Remove it:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    ```
    
    **Verify it's gone:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    # Should show nothing or only other remotes
    ```
    
    **Add it back:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
    ```
    
    **Verify:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

### Renaming Origin

??? info "Using a Different Name"
    
    You want to call it something else. Maybe you have multiple repos with different conventions.
    
    **Rename origin to github:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote rename origin github
    ```
    
    **Now you push to github:**
    
    ```bash
    git push github main
    ```
    
    But again: don't do this unless you have a good reason. Stick with `origin`.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Cloned Someone's Repo

You want to contribute. You fork their repo. You clone your fork.

```bash
# Fork on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/you/their-repo.git
cd their-repo

# Add upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/them/their-repo.git

# Check remotes
git remote -v
```

Output:

```
origin    https://github.com/you/their-repo.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/you/their-repo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/them/their-repo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/them/their-repo.git (push)
```

Now you can:

- Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/new-thing`
- Pull from original: `git fetch upstream`

### Scenario 2: Repository Moved

Your company moved from GitHub to GitLab. Same repo, different URL.

```bash
# Check current origin
git remote -v

# Update the URL
git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.com/company/repo.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

Your local repo now points to the new location. No need to re-clone.

### Scenario 3: You Have No Origin

You ran `git init` locally. No remote. You want to add one.

```bash
# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

## Common Mistakes

!!! danger "Don't Remove Origin Without a Backup"
    If you remove `origin` and forget the URL, you can't push. Make sure you know the URL before removing.
    
    **Wrong:**
    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    # Oh no, what was the URL?
    ```
    
    **Right:**
    ```bash
    # Save the URL first
    git remote -v
    # Copy the URL
    git remote remove origin
    # Now you can add it back if needed
    ```

!!! warning "Origin is Not Always Main Remote"
    In forked repos, `upstream` might be more important than `origin`. Don't assume `origin` is the source of truth.

## Best Practices

!!! success "Do This"
    - Always check remotes after cloning: `git remote -v`
    - Use `origin` for your primary remote
    - Use `upstream` for the original repo in forks
    - Name other remotes clearly: `production`, `staging`, etc.
    - Verify URL before pushing to a new remote

!!! tip "Quick Health Check"
    When you start work in a repo:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    git status
    git fetch origin
    ```
    
    You'll know exactly where your code lives and if you're synced.

## What's Next?

You understand `origin`. It's just a name. A reference to your remote repository.

Next up: branches. How local branches track remote branches. What `origin/main` means. How tracking works.

But now you know: when you see `origin`, it's just pointing to GitHub (or wherever your code is stored).
