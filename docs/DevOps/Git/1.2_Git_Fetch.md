Just check what's new.


That's `git fetch`.

## What Git Fetch Does#



It downloads information from remote. New commits. New branches. New tags. Everything.- **Retrieves the latest changes** (commits, branches, tags) from a **remote** repository.

- Updates your local metadata (remote tracking branches), but **does not** merge or apply these changes to your working branches.

But it doesn't change your files. Doesn't touch your working directory. Doesn't merge anything.- It‚Äôs **safe**: you can fetch as often as you like without worrying about overwriting local changes.



Think of it as reading the news. You're gathering information. Not taking action yet.> **Analogy**: If `git pull` is like *receiving new mail and reading it right away*, `git fetch` is like *receiving new mail and putting it aside to read later*.

Your working directory stays clean. You can review changes. Decide what to do next.## **3. Basic Usage**



## The Daily Command### **3.1 Fetch from the Default Remote**

```bash

This is what you'll use most of the time:git fetch

```

```bash- Fetches updates from **all configured remotes** (commonly `origin`).

git fetch origin- If you have only one remote, it‚Äôs effectively the same as `git fetch origin`.

```

### **3.2 Fetch from a Specific Remote**

That's it. This fetches all branches from `origin`. Updates your local knowledge of remote branches.```bash

git fetch origin

After fetching, check what's new:```

- Fetches the latest updates **only** from the remote named `origin`.

```bash- Updates **all branches** in `origin` (e.g., `origin/main`, `origin/feature-xyz`).

git status- Does **not** update local branches automatically.

```

### **3.3 Fetch Only a Specific Branch**

You'll see something like:```bash

git fetch origin main

``````

On branch main- Fetches **only** the `main` branch from the remote named `origin`.

Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 3 commits.- Updates **only** `origin/main`, without touching other branches.

  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

```---



Or check specific differences:## **4. Differences at a Glance**



```bash| Command                 | Fetches Updates From | Updates Which Branches?               | Use Case                                              |

git log main..origin/main --oneline|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

```| `git fetch`            | All remotes         | All remote tracking branches          | Check updates from all remotes                        |

| `git fetch origin`     | `origin` only       | All branches in `origin`              | Fetch all branches from `origin`                      |

This shows commits that exist on `origin/main` but not on your local `main`.| `git fetch origin main`| `origin` only       | Only `origin/main`                    | Quickly fetch updates just for the `main` branch      |



## Fetch vs Pull- **`git fetch`**: Good if you have multiple remotes or want to update all remote branches.

- **`git fetch origin`**: Focuses on fetching all branches from `origin` only.

People confuse these. They're different.- **`git fetch origin main`**: Ideal if you care only about the `main` branch.

!!! tip "Best Practice"```

    Fetch first. Review changes. Then decide to pull or merge.- Shows detailed information about what‚Äôs being fetched.

    

    ```bash---

    git fetch origin

    git log main..origin/main --oneline## **6. Viewing Fetched Changes**

    # Look at what changedAfter fetching, compare your local branch to the fetched remote branch:

    git pull origin main

    ``````bash

git log main..origin/main --oneline

## Common Workflow```

- Shows commits that exist in `origin/main` but not in your local `main`.

Here's how you'll actually use fetch:

Or use `git diff`:

### Morning Routine```bash

git diff main origin/main

You start work. Check what changed overnight.```

- Shows exact code differences.

```bash

# Fetch latest info---

git fetch origin

## **7. Applying Fetched Changes**

# Check if main movedSince fetching alone doesn‚Äôt modify your local branches, you can:

git log main..origin/main --oneline

```1. **Pull** (merge automatically)

   ```bash

If there are new commits, update your local `main`:   git pull origin main

   ```

```bash2. **Merge** (manual merge)

git checkout main   ```bash

git pull origin main   git merge origin/main

```   ```

3. **Rebase**

Now you're synced. Create your feature branch from updated `main`.   ```bash

   git rebase origin/main

### Before Creating a Pull Request   ```



Your feature is done. But the team kept working. Main moved ahead.---



```bash## **8. Example Scenarios**

# Check what changed on main

git fetch origin### **8.1 Quick Check Before Pulling**

git log origin/main --oneline -51. **Fetch** the latest changes:

```   ```bash

   git fetch origin

If main has new commits, update your branch:   ```

2. **Inspect** what‚Äôs new:

```bash   ```bash

git checkout main   git log main..origin/main --oneline

git pull origin main   ```

git checkout feature/your-feature3. **Pull** if needed:

git merge main   ```bash

```   git pull origin main

   ```

Now your branch includes the latest from main. No surprises during code review.

### **8.2 Multiple Remotes**

### Checking on Teammate's Branch1. You fork a repository, so you have:

   - `origin` ‚Üí Your fork.

Your teammate is working on `feature/payment`. You want to see their latest work.   - `upstream` ‚Üí The original repo.

2. Fetch updates from both:

```bash   ```bash

# Fetch their branch   git fetch origin

git fetch origin feature/payment   git fetch upstream

   ```

# Check what they did3. Merge changes from `upstream` if necessary.

git log origin/feature/payment --oneline -10

### **8.3 Checking a Single Branch**

# Or see the actual code```bash

git diff main origin/feature/paymentgit fetch origin feature/awesome-feature

``````

- Fetches only the specified branch from `origin`.

You didn't checkout anything. Didn't change your working directory. Just reviewed their work.

## Advanced Usage

Everything below is optional. But useful for complex scenarios.

### Fetch Commands Explained

??? abstract "Different Ways to Fetch"
    
    **Fetch everything**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch
    ```
    
    Fetches from all configured remotes. If you only have `origin`, same as `git fetch origin`.
    
    **Fetch from specific remote**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```
    
    Fetches all branches from `origin`. This is what you'll use 90% of the time.
    
    **Fetch specific branch**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch origin main
    ```
    
    Only fetches the `main` branch. Faster if you only care about one branch.
    
    **Fetch all remotes**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```
    
    If you have multiple remotes (like `origin` and `upstream`), this fetches from all of them.
    
    **Comparison:**
    
    | Command | Fetches From | Updates |
    |---------|--------------|---------|
    | `git fetch` | All remotes | All branches |
    | `git fetch origin` | origin only | All origin branches |
    | `git fetch origin main` | origin only | Only main |
    | `git fetch --all` | All remotes | All branches from all remotes |

### Cleaning Up Stale Branches

??? tip "Using --prune to Remove Dead Branches"
    
    Your teammate deleted `feature/old-work` on remote. But your local git still tracks `origin/feature/old-work`.
    
    **See stale branches:**
    
    ```bash
    git branch -r
    ```
    
    You'll see branches that don't exist on remote anymore.
    
    **Clean them up:**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --prune
    ```
    
    Or automatically prune every time:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global fetch.prune true
    ```
    
    Now every `git fetch` will remove stale branches.
    
    **Combined command:**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --all --prune
    ```
    
    Fetches from all remotes AND removes dead branches. Clean and efficient.

### Working with Multiple Remotes

??? example "Fetching from Upstream (Forked Repos)"
    
    You forked a repository. You have two remotes:
    
    - `origin` ‚Üí Your fork on GitHub
    - `upstream` ‚Üí The original repository
    
    **Setup upstream (one time):**
    
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git
    ```
    
    **Check your remotes:**
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    origin    https://github.com/you/repo.git (fetch)
    origin    https://github.com/you/repo.git (push)
    upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git (fetch)
    upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git (push)
    ```
    
    **Fetch from both:**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git fetch upstream
    ```
    
    Or fetch from all at once:
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --all
    ```
    
    **Update your fork with upstream changes:**
    
    ```bash
    # Fetch latest from upstream
    git fetch upstream
    
    # Checkout your main
    git checkout main
    
    # Merge upstream's main
    git merge upstream/main
    
    # Push to your fork
    git push origin main
    ```
    
    Now your fork is synced with the original repo.

### Viewing What Changed

??? info "Inspecting Fetched Changes"
    
    You fetched. Now what? How do you see what changed?
    
    **See commits on origin/main that you don't have:**
    
    ```bash
    git log main..origin/main --oneline
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    a3f2c1d Fix authentication bug
    b7e9f3a Add password validation
    c4d8e2f Update README
    ```
    
    **See commits you have that origin doesn't:**
    
    ```bash
    git log origin/main..main --oneline
    ```
    
    If this shows commits, you're ahead of remote.
    
    **See code differences:**
    
    ```bash
    git diff main origin/main
    ```
    
    Shows actual line-by-line changes.
    
    **See only which files changed:**
    
    ```bash
    git diff --name-only main origin/main
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    auth.js
    README.md
    package.json
    ```
    
    **See commit graph:**
    
    ```bash
    git log --oneline --graph main origin/main
    ```
    
    Visual representation of branch history.

### Fetching Tags

??? abstract "Working with Tags"
    
    Tags are version markers. Like `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`.
    
    **Fetch all tags:**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --tags
    ```
    
    **List all tags:**
    
    ```bash
    git tag
    ```
    
    **Checkout a specific version:**
    
    ```bash
    git checkout v1.0.0
    ```
    
    You're now in "detached HEAD" state, viewing the code at version 1.0.0.
    
    **Get back to your branch:**
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

### Verbose Output

??? tip "See What's Happening During Fetch"
    
    Want to see exactly what git is doing?
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --verbose
    ```
    
    Or even more detail:
    
    ```bash
    git fetch --verbose --progress
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    remote: Counting objects: 25, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
    remote: Total 25 (delta 10), reused 20 (delta 5)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (25/25), done.

    ```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Before Starting Work

You're about to start a new feature. First, sync your knowledge.

```bash
# Fetch latest info
git fetch origin

# Check if main moved
git log main..origin/main --oneline
```

If main has new commits:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-work
```

Now you're branching off the latest code.

### Scenario 2: During Code Review

Someone requested changes on your PR. Meanwhile, main moved ahead.

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch origin

# Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-work
git merge main

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature/your-work
```

### Scenario 3: Checking Teammate's Work

Your teammate asked you to review their branch before they open a PR.

```bash
# Fetch their branch
git fetch origin feature/their-work

# Compare to main
git log main..origin/feature/their-work --oneline

# See the code diff
git diff main origin/feature/their-work
```

You reviewed without touching your working directory.

## Common Mistakes

!!! danger "Don't Confuse Fetch and Pull"
    **Wrong:**
    ```bash
    # Thinking this will update your files
    git fetch origin main
    # Your files didn't change!
    ```
    
    **Right:**
    ```bash
    # Fetch to check
    git fetch origin main
    # Then pull to apply
    git pull origin main
    ```

!!! warning "Remote Branches Are Read-Only"
    You can't checkout and work on `origin/main` directly.
    
    **Wrong:**
    ```bash
    git checkout origin/main
    # You're in detached HEAD!
    ```
    
    **Right:**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    # Now you're on your local main
    ```

## Best Practices

!!! success "Do This"
    - Fetch before starting work
    - Fetch before creating a PR
    - Use `git fetch origin` as your default
    - Review changes before pulling
    - Set up auto-prune: `git config --global fetch.prune true`

!!! tip "Pro Workflow"
    Make this your morning routine:
    ```bash
    git fetch --all --prune
    git status
    git log main..origin/main --oneline
    ```
    
    You'll know exactly what changed overnight.

## What's Next?

You understand fetch. You know how to check for changes without risking your local work.

Next up: `git pull`, `git merge`, and `git rebase`. How to actually apply those fetched changes.

But fetch is your safety net. Always fetch first. Review. Then act.
