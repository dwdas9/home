## What is dbt?

dbt stands for data built tool. It's a tool to run SQL as workflows. It's almost all-SQL.

**dbt is the T in ELT.** When you use dbt the data is already present in the final destination.

## Why dbt?

Opensource. Free. Development-Testing-Deployment-Documentation-DataLineage So easily. Integrates so well with CI/CD. Resusage code with Macros and Jinja?

## So why not just use a SQL notebook in databricks?

Have you seen how notebooks run, one cell after another. Do you think workflows are always like a train? Long and linear? Workflows have branches like trees. dbt is far more than what databricks sql notebook's one cell at a time offers.

So, to summarize, with dbt, you can run sql on your data which is already `inside` like enjoying in house like lakehouse, beachhouse, warehouse etc.

## Explain more

With dbt you can put your complex sql into small small chunks. All your coding good practices like modular kitchen, git, CI/ABCD you can do with dbt.
