    === "Project and Team"
        - **Project:** ETL Modernization and Infrastructure Migration to Azure  
        - **Role**: Solution Architect / Data Engineering Lead  
        - **Team**: 15 members including Data Engineers, ETL Developers, Azure Infrastructure Specialists, and cross-functional stakeholders  
        - **Objective**:  
            - Migrate legacy on-prem Windows Servers and SQL Server databases to Azure VM and Azure SQL PaaS.  
            - Modernize SSIS ETL pipelines for document and metadata processing.  
            - Enable scalable, automated, and highly available data workflows in Azure.  
            - Reduce on-prem maintenance cost and operational risk.  

    === "Tech Stack"
        - Azure VMs (Windows Server 2016)  
        - Azure SQL Database (PaaS)  
        - SSIS / SSRS  
        - SQL Server Management Studio  
        - Power BI  
        - Docker (for legacy ECM apps)  
        - SharePoint Online  

    === "Role & Responsibilities"

        - Designed Azure-based architecture, including VM sizing, SQL PaaS, and high availability planning.  
        - Migrated on-prem SSIS ETL packages to Azure VM-hosted SQL Server, optimizing for performance and reliability.  
        - Re-engineered SSIS packages to process document metadata from legacy ECM systems efficiently.  
        - Built Azure SQL tables and schemas to capture document and operational data.  
        - Implemented automation for metadata extraction, validation, and ingestion from multiple sources.  
        - Configured Azure DR and HA strategies, including geo-redundant backups and site recovery.  
        - Conducted POCs for performance tuning of SSIS workflows and SSRS reporting.  
        - Collaborated with cross-functional teams and vendors to provision Azure infrastructure and ensure secure access.  
        - Developed technical documentation, deployment guides, and trained internal teams on new cloud-based ETL workflows.  
        - Monitored pipeline performance post-migration and ensured data quality and integrity.  

    === "Key Achievements"
    
        - Successfully migrated all on-prem SSIS ETL workflows to Azure VMs and Azure SQL.  
        - Reduced infrastructure maintenance cost by ~40% by leveraging Azure PaaS and VM-based ETL hosting.  
        - Improved ETL execution performance by ~50% through optimized SSIS workflows and SQL tuning.  
        - Enabled high availability and disaster recovery for mission-critical financial data.
