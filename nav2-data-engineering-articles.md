## Introduction

Azure Data Engineering includes a suite of tools and services to help the processing and analysis of vast datasets. Some key components include:

1. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: A cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.

2. **Azure Databricks**: An Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Azure, designed for big data analytics and machine learning.

3. **Azure Blob Storage**: Object storage service for unstructured data like text or binary data. It can handle streaming data and provides a foundation for Azure Data Lake Storage.

4. **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: A scalable and secure data lake that allows you to run big data analytics and provides massively parallel processing support.

5. **Azure Stream Analytics**: A real-time event stream processing service that can ingest, process, and store millions of events per second.

6. **Azure SQL Data Warehouse (now part of Azure Synapse Analytics)**: A fully managed, performance-optimized data warehouse that allows you to set up, operate, and scale complex datasets and use either on-demand or provisioned resources.

7. **Azure Cosmos DB**: A globally distributed, multi-model database service for large-scale applications. It supports document, key-value, graph, and column-family data models.

8. **Azure Event Hubs**: A big data streaming platform and event ingestion service that can handle millions of events per second.

9. **Azure HDInsight**: A fully-managed cloud service that makes it easy to process data using popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and others.

10. **Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse)**: Integrates big data and data warehousing, allowing users to analyze all data at scale.

In this section, we'll talk about the main parts of Azure Data Engineering. These are the parts that are very important to know well. First, we'll look at Azure Databricks, which is based on Apache Spark. Next, we'll explore Azure Data Factory, another key part. We'll also discuss other parts as we go along.
