## Dataverse

- Dataverse ~ Power Platform DB.
- Tables: Standard(OOTB), managed(part of a solution, read-only), custom
- 4TB  storage limit
- You can apply business logic to tables! E.g. If country is US, then postal code mandatory.

## Copilot

Copilot was earlier called Power Virtual Agents. This is like GPT4/Bing. Here, you just say in plain English what you want. CoPilot will create the power automate/App for you!

## Copilot Studio

Now using Copilot it becomes easy to create a working bot without the complexity which was there earlier.

## Power FX

This is the language of PowerPlatform. It's like Excel formulas. Its used in PowerApps, Dataverse and Copilot Studio.

## Power Platform & Dynamics 365

- Power Apps: All Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps are model-driven apps(built in PowerApps). - The data for such apps is in Dataverse. 
- Power BI: Can create reports from Dynamics 365
- Power Automate: Business process flows are creating using Power Automate.
- Copilot Studio: Call/SMS/Facebook Msgs -> Dynamics 365 Customer Service App -> Copilot -> Live agent
- Power Pages: Self-support web sites.

## Power Platform and Azure

Power Platform and Azure offer countless ways to create end-to-end solutions. Take, for instance, an airline project where:

- Azure API Management hosts a custom API for airline system communication.
- A coordinator handles notifications, assigns flights to Teams channels, and sends them to Power Apps.
- Azure Functions process Graph API calls from a storage queue, sending notifications to Teams and streaming events to Azure Event Hubs.
- Azure Bot Service powers a custom bot messaging service for flight updates in Teams.
- Azure Data Lake stores event data from Event Hubs for long-term retention and analytics with Power BI.

## Dataflows

- ETL tool for PowerPlatform Ecosystem
- Uses very less code
- Uses power query(Like Excel)
- No infra required, fully on cloud
- No sep license, use Power BI / Power Apps license

## Common Data Model

Common Data Model as a ready-made collection of tables. Say for healthcare you have patient table and a admission table. With this you don't have to design tables and choose columns. Microsoft has partnered with industries like Healthcare, automobile, banking to create CDM.

Long story short: Use Common Data Model. Save yourself from complex data modelling tasks.

## Data Sources | Triggers & Action | Connector Types 

**Data Sources:** 
- **Tabular:** SharePoint, SQL Server, Dataverse
- **Function Based:** 365 Users, Azure Blobs

**Connectors:** 
- Simply put, they link data sources to the Power Platform.
- Types: standard, premium, custom

![alt text](connectortype.png)

**Triggers and Actions:**
- **Triggers:** Start the flow in Power Automate, like a spark!
- **Actions:** Perform tasks or operations.
