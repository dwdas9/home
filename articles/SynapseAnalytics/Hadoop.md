### What is Hadoop?

Hadoop is a distributed file system and processing framework similar to an MSSQL cluster but designed for handling large-scale file systems and big data. Here are its main components:

- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: The file system for big data, akin to NTFS or FAT in traditional systems.
- **MapReduce**: The older generation of big data processing, similar to Spark.
- **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: The cluster manager.
- **Hadoop Common**: The set of shared libraries and utilities.
