## Uploading CSV Files from Laptop to ADLS using Copy Data Activity and SHIR

We have some CSV files on our laptop that we want to upload to a folder in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The Microsoft-recommended way to do this is by using a pipeline with the Copy Data activity, connecting through a Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR). Let's walk through the steps to achieve this:

### Create and Configure an Integration Runtime

The first of all steps it to have an integration runtime which is the backbone of our connection to the local folder. 
- In your synapse workspace go to **Manage** -> **Integration** -> **Integration runtime**. 
- Click on **New**, then in the settings, you will have two options. Choose an **express setup**.

   Express setup is a quicker option as it both installs and links the local IR environment with the synapse setup. If you prefer to do a manual setup, refer to to appenxis.
   </p>

### Create Two Linked Services (Connection Strings)

Next, we need to create two connection strings (also known as Linked Services): one to the local laptop's folder (source) and another to the ADLS (destination).

#### Linked Service to Laptop's Folder

1. In Synapse workspace, go to **Manage** -> **Linked Services** -> **New**.
2. Select **File System** and provide a name for the linked service.
3. Select the Integration Runtime we created earlier.

4. Specify the path to the CSV files on your laptop and provide a user name and password which has read/write access to the folder.

   <p style="color: #006600; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #00cc66;">
   Here, sa is a local user which  has read/write access to the folder. 
   </p>

#### A commonly encountered error

After setting up the linked service when you Test connection it may  fail.

This has nothing to do with the setup but a windows security feature which causes the issue. To resolve this, open **Command Prompt** as **Administrator** and run the following commands:

   ```shell
   cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Integration Runtime\5.0\Shared
   .\dmgcmd.exe -DisableLocalFolderPathValidation
   ```

This will disable local folder path validation, and Test connection will pass this time.

### Linked Service to ADLS

1. Navigate to **Manage** -> **Linked Services** -> **New**.
2. Select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** and provide the necessary details like account name, account key, or SAS token.

### Create a Pipeline with Copy Data Activity

Now that the linked services are configured, create a pipeline to copy data:

1. In Synapse workspace, go to **Integrate** -> **Pipelines** -> **New Pipeline**.

2. **Add Copy Data Activity**: Drag and drop the **Copy Data** activity onto the pipeline canvas.
3. **Configure the Source**: Select the linked service for the laptop's folder and specify the file path and format (CSV).
4. **Configure the Sink**: Select the linked service for ADLS and specify the destination folder.

### Execute the Pipeline

1. **Validate the Pipeline**: Ensure all configurations are correct and validate the pipeline.
2. **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the pipeline to start the data transfer from your laptop to ADLS.

The integratoin runtime  can also be downloaded and installed seprately from Microsoft software store

Install it on your local machine. The steps are pretty simple. Just click click.
