## Perform Data Validation and Quality Checks

Before you organize your data into a specific model or format, it's crucial to ensure the data is correct and of high quality. Validation includes checking for correct data types, missing or null values, adherence to a predefined schema, and other business rule validations. This step is essential to avoid the "garbage in, garbage out" problem.

### Data Validation and Quality Check Strategy

#### Validation Points:
1. **Schema Validation:**
   - Ensure fields like `temp_c`, `lat`, `lon`, etc., are of correct data types (e.g., float, integer).

2. **Range Checks:**
   - Validate values within expected ranges, e.g., latitude between -90 and 90.

3. **Consistency Checks:**
   - Cross-check related data points (e.g., `temp_c` and `temp_f` should match in Celsius/Fahrenheit conversions).

4. **Temporal Consistency:**
   - Check for correct time zone conversions and alignment of `localtime`.

5. **Missing Data:**
   - Look for nulls or missing values where not expected.

6. **Duplication Checks:**
   - Ensure there are no duplicate records.


### Script Overview

This script will use a combination of `great-expectations`, `Pandera`, and `Pydantic` for data validation, and is designed to be run in a Spark environment. The objective is to use of these popular validation libraries.

1. **Data Reading**: Leverage Spark to read JSON files from ADLS.
2. **Validation**: 
   - Use `Pydantic` for schema validation.
   - Implement `Pandera` for range and consistency checks.
   - Utilize `great-expectations` for more complex validations like temporal consistency, missing data, and duplication checks.
3. **Data Modeling**: Define a data model, perhaps a star schema for data warehousing.
4. **Parquet Conversion**: Prepare for converting the validated and modeled data into Parquet (to be detailed later).

### Python Script Skeleton

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
from pandera import DataFrameSchema, Column, Check
import great_expectations as ge
import pandas as pd

# Part 1: Spark Session Initialization
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WeatherDataProcessor").getOrCreate()

# Part 2: Read JSON files from ADLS (based on your ADLSSorter script)
# [ ... Existing ADLSSorter code to fetch files ... ]

# Pydantic model for schema validation
class WeatherData(BaseModel):
    lat: float
    lon: float
    temp_c: float
    temp_f: float
    localtime_epoch: int

    @validator('temp_c')
    def temp_celsius_fahrenheit_match(cls, v, values, **kwargs):
        # Validate temp_c and temp_f conversion
        temp_f = values.get('temp_f')
        if temp_f and abs(temp_f - (v * 9/5 + 32)) > 0.1:
            raise ValueError('temp_c and temp_f do not match')
        return v

# Pandera schema for range and consistency checks
weather_schema = DataFrameSchema({
    "lat": Column(float, Check(lambda x: -90 <= x <= 90)),
    "lon": Column(float, Check(lambda x: -180 <= x <= 180)),
    # ... additional range checks ...
})

# Great Expectations for more advanced checks
def validate_with_great_expectations(df):
    # Define expectations (temporal consistency, missing data, etc.)
    # ge_df = ge.from_pandas(df)
    # ge_df.expect_column_values_to_be_between(...)
    # ... define other expectations ...
    pass

# Main processing loop
for file_path in old_files:
    # Read data
    df = spark.read.json(file_path)
    pd_df = df.toPandas()

    # Validate data
    # Pydantic
    try:
        WeatherData(**pd_df.to_dict(orient="list"))
    except ValidationError as e:
        print(f"Validation error: {e}")

    # Pandera
    try:
        weather_schema.validate(pd_df)
    except SchemaError as e:
        print(f"Schema validation error: {e}")

    # Great Expectations
    validate_with_great_expectations(pd_df)

    # Data Modeling and Transformation (to be defined)
    # ...

# Note: Conversion to Parquet will be handled in the next phase.

```

## Create a Data Model

Once you're confident in your data quality, the next step is to structure or model the data. This could mean transforming raw data into a more meaningful and usable format, aligning it with a dimensional model (like a star schema), or preparing it for specific analytical needs. This stage is where you'd typically perform operations like filtering, grouping, aggregating, or joining different data sets.

### Benefits of a data model

Storing files as Parquet without a specific schema or structure is okay if you're merely archiving data or doing simple, infrequent analytics. However, for more complex analytics and reporting, creating a proper data model can have several benefits, like:

**a) Faster Query Performance**:
- By organizing data into a structured model (like star or snowflake schema), you can optimize query performance. The data model reduces the amount of data scanned during queries.

**b) Understandability and Consistency**:
- Having a defined schema makes it easier for data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders to understand the data. It ensures everyone is working with data in a consistent manner.

**c) Joining Multiple Data Sources**:
- If you have (or plan to have) multiple data sources, a structured data model simplifies joining them. For instance, weather data can be enriched with location data, demographic data, etc.

**d) Data Integrity**:
- A structured data model, especially when coupled with a database or data warehouse, can ensure data integrity with primary and foreign key constraints.

**e) Improved Data Quality**:
- Data models can have defined constraints, ensuring that incoming data meets specific quality standards.

**Star Schema**:
- A commonly used schema in data warehousing. It includes a central fact table (e.g., hourly weather measurements) and surrounding dimension tables (e.g., location, date, time). It's simple and often results in fast query performances.

**Snowflake Schema**:
- A normalized version of the star schema. It can save storage but might result in more complex queries.

### Consideration

When deciding on whether to structure your Parquet files according to a data model, consider:
- The types of queries you'll be running.
- The expected volume of data.
- The frequency of data access.
- Whether you plan to integrate with other data sources in the future.

## **Conversion to Parquet**: 

After the data is validated and properly modeled, converting it into an efficient storage format like Parquet is the final step. Parquet is a columnar storage format, offering efficient data compression and encoding schemes. This format is optimal for analytic querying performance and works well with big data technologies. Converting to Parquet after validation and modeling ensures that you're storing high-quality, well-structured data, making your analytics processes more efficient.

### Conversion to parquet Strategy:

When considering a robust data storage strategy, especially for data analytics and long-term storage, the structure and features of Parquet come into play. Parquet is a columnar storage file format, which is optimized for use with big data processing tools like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and many others. Here's what you should consider for the best Parquet structure:

1. **Columnar Storage**: Take advantage of Parquet's columnar storage format. This means when querying specific columns, only those columns' data will be read, resulting in improved performance and reduced I/O.

2. **Schema Evolution**: One of the significant advantages of Parquet is its ability to handle schema evolution. Make sure your solution can accommodate changes to the schema over time without affecting the existing data.

3. **Compression**: Parquet supports various compression techniques like SNAPPY, GZIP, and more. Depending on your analytics use-case, select the compression method that offers a good trade-off between storage cost and query performance.

4. **Partitioning**: For your use-case, since you are already organizing by year, month, day, and hour, you should partition the Parquet files this way. This will speed up query times since only the relevant partitions need to be read.

   - Example: `/year=2023/month=10/day=17/hour=13/data.parquet`

5. **Row Group Size**: Parquet organizes data into smaller row groups, allowing for more efficient column pruning. Adjusting the size of row groups can have a performance impact. The default is typically 128MB, but you might want to adjust based on your typical query patterns.

6. **Metadata**: Parquet files store metadata about the data they contain, which helps in understanding the schema and optimizing queries. Ensure this metadata is kept up-to-date.

7. **Consistent Schema**: Ensure that the schema for your Parquet files remains consistent, especially if you're ingesting data regularly. Any changes in the incoming JSON schema should be handled gracefully.

8. **Data Lake Integration**: Since you're using Azure Data Lake Storage, ensure that the tools you're using for analytics are well-integrated with ADLS and can take full advantage of the features both ADLS and Parquet provide.

9. **Regular Compaction**: Over time, as data gets updated or deleted, you might end up with many small Parquet files. This is suboptimal for query performance. Implement a regular compaction process to combine these smaller files into larger, more efficient Parquet files.

10. **Avoiding Too Many Small Files**: If your ingestion process creates too many small files, it can degrade performance. Consider batching incoming data to create larger Parquet files.

Given the JSON structure you provided, you might want to flatten it out a bit for more effective columnar storage, unless you're often querying multiple subfields of `location` or `current` together. The columnar nature of Parquet means that nesting can sometimes reduce performance benefits, especially if the data is queried column-by-column.
