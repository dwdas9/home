### Understanding `diff` and `patch`

When working with code, especially with a team, it's important to handle changes efficiently. Two handy tools for this are `diff` and `patch`.

#### `diff`

The `diff` command helps you compare two files line by line and shows you the differences. This makes it easy to see what changes have been made.

**Example:**

Suppose you have two versions of a Python file, `file1.py` and `file2.py`. You want to check what changes were made from `file1.py` to `file2.py`.

```bash
diff file1.py file2.py
```

The output might look like this:

```diff
3c3
< print("Hello, World!")
---
> print("Hello, Universe!")
```

This output means that line 3 in `file1.py`, which prints "Hello, World!", has been changed to print "Hello, Universe!" in `file2.py`.

#### `patch`

The `patch` command lets you apply changes to a file based on a `diff` file. This is useful for sharing updates or fixes without needing to send the entire file.

**Example:**

You have a `diff` file, `changes.diff`, which contains the differences between two versions of a file. You want to apply these changes to `file1.py`.

```bash
patch file1.py < changes.diff
```

This command updates `file1.py` with the changes specified in `changes.diff`.
