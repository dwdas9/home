## Background

Synapse Real-Time Analytics in Fabric uses a KQL Database. In Fabric, you only need a source and a Kusto database to start streaming data in and out of Fabric and writing your queries using KQL. Microsoft Fabric also provides KQL Querysets that can be shared within the tenant and Power BI using what's known as quick create.

###  Synapse Real-Time Analytics - Let's get started

Create a Eventhouse first - Eventhouses are groups of Databases.

When you create a Eventhouse Fabric will create a KQL Databse with the same name inside it.

Now save this csv table to dekstop and ingest this data into the KQL datbase:

The data ingestion is pretty straightforward. Once you ingest you can see the table you created to ingest the data with the required columns:

### KQL - its so easy to learn


**Select where**

```kql
sales
| where Country == 'Peru'
```

**Select where multiple clause**
```kql
sales
| where Name == 'Tom'
| where Place == 'USA'
```

**Little more complex**

### Create a Power BI report from KQL Queryset

Click on the 3 dots next to the table. Select Show any 100 records. It will open the KQL editor. Create your custom KQL query. You can either save it or create the Power BI report right from the editor.

## KQL Cheatsheet

Sure, here's the table without the "Learn more" column and with color coding for better readability:

| <span style="color: blue;">Category</span>                    | <span style="color: green;">SQL Query</span>                               | <span style="color: red;">Kusto Query</span>                                         |
