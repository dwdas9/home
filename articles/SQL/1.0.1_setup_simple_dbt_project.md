## Background

Here, I will show you how to setup a simple dbt project setup from scratch. You will just need a windows laptop for this as I have done it on my Windows machine.

## Google console pre-requisite setup
### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - In the top left corner, click on the **Project** dropdown and select **New Project**.
   - Enter a **Project Name** (e.g., `my-dbt-project`).
   - Note down the **Project ID**; you’ll need this later. This is typically something like `my-dbt-project-123456`.

3. **Set the Project as Active**:
   - Click on the **Project** dropdown again and select your newly created project to make it active.

### Step 2: Enable BigQuery API
1. **Enable the BigQuery API**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for "BigQuery API" and click **Enable**.

### Step 3: Create a Service Account
1. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
   - Enter a **Service Account Name** (e.g., `dbt-service-account`).
   - Click **Create and Continue**.

2. **Grant the Service Account Permissions**:
   - Under **Role**, select **BigQuery Admin**. This gives the service account full access to BigQuery.
   - Click **Continue** and then **Done**.

3. **Create and Download the JSON Key**:
   - In the Service Accounts list, find your new service account and click on it.
   - Go to the **Keys** tab, click **Add Key** > **Create New Key**.
   - Select **JSON** and click **Create**.
   - The JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer. This is the key file you will use in dbt.

### Step 4: Set Up Google Cloud SDK (Optional, but Recommended)
1. **Install Google Cloud SDK**:
   - If you don’t already have it installed, you can download it from [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
   - Follow the instructions to install it on your machine.

2. **Authenticate with the SDK**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth login
     ```
   - This will open a browser window where you can log in with your Google account.

3. **Set the Active Project**:
   - Run the following command to set your project as the active project:
     ```bash
     gcloud config set project your_project_id
     ```
   - Replace `your_project_id` with the actual Project ID you noted earlier.

### Step 5: Create a BigQuery Dataset
1. **Navigate to BigQuery** in the Google Cloud Console.
2. **Create a Dataset**:
   - Click on your project name to expand it, then click **Create Dataset**.
   - Enter a **Dataset ID** (e.g., `my_dataset`).
   - Configure location and other settings as needed, then click **Create Dataset**.

### Step 6: Note Down the Information
Make sure you have the following information handy:
- **Project ID**: Your Google Cloud Project ID (e.g., `my-dbt-project-123456`).
- **Service Account JSON Key File**: The path to the JSON file you downloaded (e.g., `/path/to/your-service-account-file.json`).
- **Dataset ID**: The ID of the dataset you created (e.g., `my_dataset`).

### Step 7: Start Creating Your dbt Project
Now you’re ready to create your dbt project using the above information. When dbt asks for:
- **BigQuery**: Choose BigQuery as your data warehouse.
- **Key File Path**: Provide the path to the JSON key file.
- **Project ID**: Enter the Google Cloud Project ID.
- **Dataset**: Enter the Dataset ID you created in BigQuery.

### Step 1: Install dbt and BigQuery Adapter
1. Just **create a folder**, say, dbt-bigquery, CD to it and run `python -m venv dbt-venv`. You will see a folder created `dbt-venv`
2. Activate the dbt-venv by running `dbt-venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Run the following commands to install dbt and the BigQuery adapter:
   ```bash
   pip install dbt-core dbt-bigquery
   ```
   This will install dbt and the necessary adapter to connect to BigQuery.

### Step 3: Initialize a dbt Project
1. In your terminal inside Visual Studio Code, run:
   ```bash
   dbt init your_project_name
   ```
   Replace `your_project_name` with the name you want for your dbt project.

2. **Navigate** to the newly created project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your_project_name
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Your dbt Project for BigQuery
1. **Open the `profiles.yml` file**:
   - If you don't have one, you can create it in `~/.dbt/`.
   - The file should look like this:
     ```yaml
     your_project_name:
       target: dev
       outputs:
         dev:
           type: bigquery
           method: service-account
           project: your-gcp-project-id
           dataset: your_dataset_name
           threads: 1
           keyfile: /path/to/your-service-account-file.json
           timeout_seconds: 300
           location: your_location
     ```
   - Replace `your_project_name`, `your-gcp-project-id`, `your_dataset_name`, and `/path/to/your-service-account-file.json` with your actual project details.

2. **Save the file**.

### Step 5: Create Models and Start Developing
1. **Open the `models` folder** in your dbt project.
2. Create a new `.sql` file for each model you want to define. For example:
   ```sql
   -- my_first_model.sql
   SELECT *
   FROM `your_gcp_project.your_dataset.your_table`
   ```
   Replace `your_gcp_project`, `your_dataset`, and `your_table` with the actual names.

### Step 6: Run Your dbt Models
1. In the terminal, inside your dbt project directory, run:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```
   This will execute your models and create the tables or views in BigQuery.

### Step 7: Check Your Work
1. **Check BigQuery** to see if your tables or views have been created as expected.

### Step 8: Version Control (Optional)
1. **Initialize a Git repository** in your project directory:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Add and commit your files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Final Tips
- **Always test your models** by running `dbt run` regularly to ensure everything is working.
- **Use dbt docs** to generate documentation with `dbt docs generate`.

That's it! You've set up a dbt project for BigQuery using Visual Studio Code. Happy developing!
