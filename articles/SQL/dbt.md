## What is dbt?

dbt stands for data built tool. It's a tool to run SQL as workflows. It's almost all-SQL.

**dbt is the T in ELT.**

## Why dbt?

Opensource, free. Dbt uses only SQL, no learning. Now, mostly things are ELT. And, dbt only works as transformation and no exttaction and load. So dbt is good with the appraoch. ALso, version control, CI/CD document generation etc.

Now, dbt is popular as man many companies are doing ELT. Dbt is the T in the ELT.

## So why not just use a SQL notebook in databricks?

Have you seen how notebooks run, one cell after another. Do you think workflows are always like a train? Long and linear? Workflows have branches like trees. dbt is far more than what databricks sql notebook's one cell at a time offers.

So, to summarize, with dbt, you can run sql on your data which is already `inside` like enjoying in house like lakehouse, beachhouse, warehouse etc.
