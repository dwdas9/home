# OPENROWSET - The Powerful Transact-SQL for Data Engineering.

## What is OPENROWSET?

`OPENROWSET` is a Transact-SQL function. Using this, you can create a select statement from external data sources (CSV, Parquet, JSON, Delta, ADLS, Blob) as if it were a local database. You don't need to create a table or linked service to run this. Hence, it's fast and requires fewer lines of code.

It is used in SQL Server, Azure SQL DB, Synapse Analytics, Fabric, and Databricks.

<p style="color: #006600; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #00cc66;">
For `OPENROWSET` to work, you need to ensure that the Synapse workspace or the query has the appropriate authentication to access the external data source.
</p>

## Practical scenarios where OPENROWSET is preferred

1. **Ad-Hoc Data Retrieval:**
   - **Scenario:** A business analyst needs to quickly retrieve data from an Excel file for an ad-hoc report.
   - **Reason:** OPENROWSET allows for on-the-fly access to the Excel file without the need to import it into SQL Server first, providing immediate data retrieval for analysis.

2. **Cross-Database Queries:**
   - **Scenario:** A developer needs to run a query that joins tables from different SQL Server instances.
   - **Reason:** OPENROWSET can be used to run distributed queries across different servers, avoiding the need to set up linked servers which can be more complex and require additional configuration and permissions.

3. **Accessing External Data Sources:**
   - **Scenario:** A company needs to integrate data from a remote Oracle database for a one-time data migration task.
   - **Reason:** OPENROWSET provides a quick way to query data from the Oracle database using an OLE DB provider, bypassing the need for more permanent and complex solutions like linked servers or SSIS packages.

4. **Temporary Data Access:**
   - **Scenario:** During a data validation process, a data engineer needs to access data from a CSV file provided by a client.
   - **Reason:** OPENROWSET allows the engineer to read the CSV file directly into a SQL query, facilitating temporary data access without the overhead of creating permanent database tables or ETL processes.

5. **Data Import for Development and Testing:**
   - **Scenario:** Developers need to import data from various formats (e.g., Excel, CSV) into a development environment for testing purposes.
   - **Reason:** OPENROWSET can be used to import data directly into the development environment without the need for pre-configured data import processes, speeding up the testing and development cycles.


## Syntax
```sql
-- General Syntax
OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'file_path',
    FORMAT = 'file_format',
    [DATA_SOURCE = 'data_source_name'],
    [WITH ( column_name column_type [ 'column_ordinal' | 'json_path' ] )]
) AS alias_name

-- Example for CSV
SELECT * 
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/file.csv',
    FORMAT = 'CSV',
    FIRSTROW = 2,
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n'
) AS [result]

-- Example for Parquet
SELECT * 
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/file.parquet',
    FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
) AS [result]

-- Example for Delta Lake
SELECT * 
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/file.delta',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS [result]
```

### Key Options
- **BULK**: Specifies the path to the file(s).
- **FORMAT**: Specifies the file format (`CSV`, `PARQUET`, or `DELTA`).
- **DATA_SOURCE**: (Optional) Specifies the external data source.
- **WITH**: Defines the schema of the columns to be read.

### Options for CSV
- **FIELDTERMINATOR**: Character used to separate fields (default is `,`).
- **ROWTERMINATOR**: Character used to separate rows (default is `\n`).
- **FIRSTROW**: Specifies the first row to read (default is 1).
- **HEADER_ROW**: Indicates if the CSV file contains a header row (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).

## Examples

1. **Reading a CSV file without specifying a schema:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/data.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV'
    ) AS [data]
    ```

2. **Reading specific columns from a CSV file:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/data.csv',
        FORMAT = 'CSV',
        FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
        ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
        FIRSTROW = 2
    )
    WITH (
        col1 VARCHAR(50),
        col2 INT,
        col3 DATE
    ) AS [data]
    ```

3. **Reading a Parquet file:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/data.parquet',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
    ) AS [data]
    ```

4. **Reading a Delta Lake file:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/data.delta',

# <span style="color: BlueViolet">APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT</span> when <span style="color: CornflowerBlue">COUNT(DISTINCT ColName)</span> runs forever

Imagine your table has 1 trillion rows. You want to count distinct customer names. Do you think `COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerName)` will show you results in your lifetime?

No, for such scenarios, use `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(ColName)`. It will give you around 97% accuracy.

## <span style="color: DarkCyan">How to run it?</span>

Pretty simple and straightforward.

**Normal Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerName) FROM Customers;
```

**Approximate Count**

```sql 
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(CustomerName) FROM Customers; 
```
## <span style="color: Gray">Some Fun facts about this T-SQL function</span>

In MS SQL Server `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` it first came in **SQL Server 2019**. It is **available in Synapse SQL**. These other brands support this function:

1. **Google BigQuery**
2. **Amazon Redshift**: It offers the `APPROXIMATE COUNT(DISTINCT column)` function, which serves a similar purpose.
3. **PostgreSQL**: The `approx_count_distinct` extension is available through the `HLL (HyperLogLog)` extension, which allows for approximate distinct counting.
4. **Apache Spark**: The `approx_count_distinct` function is available in Spark SQL, which uses HyperLogLog for approximate counting.

   - **Description**: Returns all rows from both tables, with matching rows from both sides. Non-matching rows are returned as NULL.
   - **Alternative Names**: **FULL OUTER JOIN**
   - **Use Case**: Used when you need to include all rows from both tables, even if no matches exist.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM employees
     FULL JOIN departments
     ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
     ```

## 5. **CROSS JOIN**
   - **Description**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables. Each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used when you want to combine every row from one table with every row from another table. Typically used for generating combinations or testing.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM products
     CROSS JOIN suppliers;
     ```

## 6. **SELF JOIN**
   - **Description**: A table is joined with itself to compare rows within the same table.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used for hierarchical relationships (e.g., finding managers for employees in the same table).
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT e1.name AS Employee, e2.name AS Manager
     FROM employees e1
     LEFT JOIN employees e2
     ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
     ```

## 7. **NATURAL JOIN**
   - **Description**: Automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name in both tables. No need to explicitly specify the join condition.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used when both tables have the same column names and you want an automatic join on those columns.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM employees
     NATURAL JOIN departments;
     ```

## 8. **ANTI JOIN** (also known as **LEFT ANTI JOIN**)
   - **Description**: Returns rows from the left table where no matching rows exist in the right table.
   - **Alternative Names**: **LEFT ANTI JOIN**
   - **Use Case**: Used when you need rows from the left table that do not have a corresponding match in the right table.
   - **Example** (using `LEFT JOIN` and filtering `NULL`):
     ```sql
     SELECT employees.name
     FROM employees
     LEFT JOIN departments
     ON employees.department_id = departments.id
     WHERE departments.id IS NULL;
     ```

## 9. **SEMI JOIN** (also known as **LEFT SEMI JOIN** or **RIGHT SEMI JOIN**)
   - **Description**: Returns rows from the left table where a match exists in the right table, but only columns from the left table are returned.
   - **Alternative Names**: **LEFT SEMI JOIN**, **RIGHT SEMI JOIN**
   - **Use Case**: Used when you need to know which rows in the left table have a match in the right table but only need the left table's columns.
   - **Example** (using `EXISTS`):
     ```sql
     SELECT employees.name
     FROM employees
     WHERE EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 
         FROM departments
         WHERE employees.department_id = departments.id
     );
     ```

## 10. **EXCEPT JOIN**
   - **Description**: Combines two result sets and returns rows from the left set that are not in the right set.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used for set difference operations where you need to find rows in one table that don't exist in another.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees
     EXCEPT
     SELECT * FROM employees_in_department;
     ```

## 11. **OUTER APPLY**
   - **Description**: Similar to a left join but with subqueries evaluated per row in the left table.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used when you need a subquery or table-valued function evaluated once per row in the left table.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employees.name, department_details.*
     FROM employees
     OUTER APPLY getDepartmentDetails(employees.department_id) AS department_details;
     ```

## 12. **INNER APPLY**
   - **Description**: Similar to an inner join but with subqueries evaluated per row in the left table.
   - **Alternative Names**: None
   - **Use Case**: Used when you want to perform an inner join with a subquery or table-valued function evaluated per row.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     SELECT employees.name, department_details.*
     FROM employees
     INNER APPLY getDepartmentDetails(employees.department_id) AS department_details;
     ```
