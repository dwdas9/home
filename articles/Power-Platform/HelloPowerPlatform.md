Its data can live in SharePoint, Dynamics, M365, or anywhere. Its language is PowerFX (like Excel formulas). Power apps are canvas apps (any data) and model-driven apps (Dataverse only).
- <span style="color: #008080;">Power Automate</span> - Workflows to automate work tasks.
- <span style="color: #800080;">Power BI</span> - Data dashboards and reports.
- <span style="color: #4169E1;">Power Pages</span> - For websites.

## <span style="color: #4C9A2A;">Supporting Tools</span>

- <span style="color: #FF8C00;">Copilot Studio [Power Virtual Agents]</span> - Tool to automate the automation.
- <span style="color: #008080;">Connectors</span> - Connect to Dropbox, Twitter, etc. Approx 900.
- <span style="color: #800080;">AI Builder</span> - Add AI functionality to Power Automate and Power Apps.

## Power Platform & Dynamics 365

- **Power Apps:** All Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps are model-driven apps (built in PowerApps). The data for such apps is in Dataverse.
- **Power BI:** Can create reports from Dynamics 365.
- **Power Automate:** Business process flows are created using Power Automate.
- **Copilot Studio:** Call/SMS/Facebook Msgs -> Dynamics 365 Customer Service App -> Copilot -> Live agent.
- **Power Pages:** Self-support websites.

## Power Platform and Azure

Power Platform and Azure offer countless ways to create end-to-end solutions. For instance, an airline project where:

- Azure API Management hosts a custom API for airline system communication.
- A coordinator handles notifications, assigns flights to Teams channels, and sends them to Power Apps.
- Azure Functions process Graph API calls from a storage queue, sending notifications to Teams and streaming events to Azure Event Hubs.
- Azure Bot Service powers a custom bot messaging service for flight updates in Teams.
- Azure Data Lake stores event data from Event Hubs for long-term retention and analytics with Power BI.

## Common Data Model

Common Data Model is a ready-made collection of tables. For healthcare, you have a patient table and an admission table. With this, you don't have to design tables and choose columns. Microsoft has partnered with industries like healthcare, automobile, and banking to create CDM.

Long story short: Use Common Data Model. Save yourself from complex data modeling tasks.

## Data Sources | Triggers & Actions | Connector Types
