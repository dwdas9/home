Image capture and extraction workflows are heavily used in the Banking and Insurance sectors. Almost all institutions use products like <span style="color:green;">OpenText inteligent capture, Kofax Capture, Datacap </span> etc to Capture documents from multiple channels and store them in backend ECM systems like Opentext content server, SharePoint server etc.

### <span style="color: Red;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Our Workflow</span>

This guide outlines how to capture and extract data from invoices and store them in SharePoint using a simple workflow. Invoices are placed in a dedicated folder on OneDrive and processed automatically when a new file is detected by the Power Automate OneDrive trigger.

### <span style="color: DodgerBlue;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">How to Create the Workflow</span>

Follow these steps to set up the automated workflow:

1. In Power Automate, click **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow**. Provide a flow name, enter **When a file is created** in the search box, and then select **When a file is created (OneDrive for Business)**.

2. Click on **Next Step**, then **+ New step**. To specify the folder to monitor, click on the folder icon under **Parameters** and select the OneDrive folder that will contain the invoices.

6. Configure the **Create file** action with the following details:
   - **Site Address**: Enter the SharePoint site URL where the document library is located.
   - **Folder Path**: Choose the document library.
   - **File Name**: Select **When a file is created** > **File name**.
   - **File Content**: Choose **When a file is created** > **File content**.

7. Add an action for **SharePoint** > **Update file properties**. Configure it by providing:
   - The site address hosting the document library.
   - The document library from the dropdown menu.
   - **Id**: Select **Create file** > **body** > **ItemId**.
   - Map the properties of the document with values extracted from the invoice in the previous steps.

8. To test the flow, click **Test**, opt for a manual test, and place a file in the monitored OneDrive folder. After a short period, the flow will trigger, and the SharePoint library will be updated with the document and all extracted metadata.

Choosing between AI-based methods and traditional document capture software like Kofax Capture or Captiva Capture involves a careful evaluation of various factors:

- **Licensing Costs**: Traditional software often has licensing fees based on usage volume. For instance, a Kofax Capture license for processing 100,000 pages annually may cost approximately $16,526.00 [Kofax Capture License Cost](https://www.shi.com/product/42180951/Kofax-Capture-License).
  
- **Functionality and Modules**: OpenText Intelligent Capture (formerly Captiva) includes a suite of modules designed for different aspects of document handling, such as Standard Import, Standard Export, and Completion (for manual verification), as well as eInput (for browser-based capture). These features may integrate seamlessly into the workflow of financial or insurance environments, offering out-of-the-box solutions.

- **Integration and Customization**: Microsoft Power Automate allows for the creation of customized document capture workflows, which can be advantageous for those already utilizing the Microsoft 365 platform. It offers a way to avoid substantial licensing fees while still achieving a high level of functionality.

- **Scan-to-network-folder**: A very typical document capture is to scan to a network folder and use Captiv standard import to crate batches. I have seen that this workflow can be easily created using Power Autoamte. All you have to do is configure your scanner to scan to the oneDrive folder.

**Long story short:** The decision hinges on your company's specific needs, existing infrastructure, and budget. For future reference, should this subject arise, consider conducting a POC to show the power of Power Automate to your management team and let them take a call!
