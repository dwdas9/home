# **Hadoop Modes of Operation**

Hadoop can work in three different modes, each suited for different environments and use cases. Let's look at them briefly:

## **1. Standalone Mode**

This is the simplest mode of Hadoop. In **Standalone Mode**, Hadoop runs on a **single machine** and doesn't use **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**. It's mostly used for testing and learning because there's no real **distribution** of data or processing.

- **No HDFS**: Files are stored locally.
- **No distributed processing**: Everything happens on one machine.
- **Use Case**: Good for testing code or doing small experiments.

## **2. Pseudo-distributed Mode**

In **Pseudo-distributed Mode**, Hadoop runs on a **single machine**, but it behaves as if itâ€™s a **distributed system**. Each Hadoop service like **NameNode, DataNode**, and **ResourceManager** runs as a separate process on the same machine.

- **HDFS is used**: Data is distributed across simulated nodes (which are really just separate processes on the same machine).
- **Single machine but acts distributed**.
- **Use Case**: For developers who want to test on a single machine but still mimic how Hadoop behaves in a real environment.

## **3. Fully-Distributed Mode**

In **Fully-Distributed Mode**, Hadoop runs across multiple machines. Each service (like **NameNode, DataNode**, etc.) runs on different machines, and data is truly distributed.

- **Real distribution**: Data is spread across many machines.
- **Use Case**: This is used in production environments where Hadoop processes large datasets across a cluster of machines.

### **Key Takeaway**

- **Standalone**: All on one machine, no HDFS.
- **Pseudo-distributed**: Simulates distribution on one machine.
- **Fully-distributed**: Runs across multiple machines, real-world usage.
