## Understanding Python's `sort()` Method

Let's start with a surprising example:

```python
numbers = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

sorted_numbers = numbers.sort()

print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: None
```

In this example, the output is `None`. Surprised and expected [1,2,3,4,5]?.

### Let's find out what happens in the backend

**The `sort()` method sorts a list without creating a new list.**

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of a list in place, meaning it modifies the original list directly without creating a new list. It does not return a new sorted list, but rather updates the existing list and returns `None`.

This is the key difference between the `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function. The `sorted()` function returns a new list that is sorted, while the `sort()` method sorts the list it is called on and does not create a new list.

### Let's see some examples

**Example 1: Using `sort()` method**

```python
numbers = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

numbers.sort()

print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example 2: Using `sorted()` function**

```python
numbers = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)  # Output: [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]
```

### Sorting in reverse order

```python
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
```
