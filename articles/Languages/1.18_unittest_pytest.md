### Introduction to `pytest`

`pytest` is a popular tool for testing Python code. It's known for being easy to use and having many useful features.

### Key Features of `pytest`

1. **Simple Syntax**: You write tests with plain Python functions starting with `test_`. Use standard `assert` statements for checks. This makes it easy to start testing.

2. **Rich Assertions**: `pytest` provides clear failure reports. If a test fails, it shows what went wrong with details on variables and expressions.

3. **Fixtures**: Fixtures help set up and clean up before and after tests. They let you reuse code for preparing test data or resources.

4. **Parametrization**: You can run the same test with different inputs using `pytest`. This saves you from writing multiple similar tests.

5. **Plugins and Extensions**: There are many plugins to add extra features like running tests in parallel, checking code coverage, and more.

6. **Test Discovery**: `pytest` finds and runs tests automatically by looking for files and functions that follow certain naming rules.

These features make `pytest` a powerful and flexible tool for testing Python code.

### Writing Tests with `pytest`

To get started with `pytest`, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Create a test file (e.g., `test_sample.py`) and write a simple test function:

```python
def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

Run the test using the `pytest` command:

```bash
pytest
```

`pytest` will automatically find and run the test, providing a summary of the results.

### Advanced Features

- **Fixtures**: Define a fixture using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator to provide setup code for your tests:

    ```python
    import pytest

    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_data():
        return [1, 2, 3]

    def test_sum(sample_data):
        assert sum(sample_data) == 6
    ```

- **Parametrization**: Use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to run tests with multiple sets of parameters:

    ```python
    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("a, b, expected", [
        (1, 1, 2),
        (2, 3, 5),
        (5, 5, 10)
    ])
    def test_add(a, b, expected):
        assert a + b == expected
    ```

## Unit test example

### `rearrange.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import re

def rearrange_name(full_name):
    match = re.search(r"^([\w .]*), ([\w .]*)$", full_name)
    return "{} {}".format(match[2], match[1])
```

### `rearrange_test.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import unittest
from rearrange import rearrange_name

class TestRearrange(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_rearrange(self):
        input_name = "Lovelace, Ada"
        expected_output = "Ada Lovelace"
        self.assertEqual(rearrange_name(input_name), expected_output)

# Run the tests
unittest.main()
```

### Running the Test

```bash
chmod +x rearrange_test.py
./rearrange_test.py
```

### Unittest vs. Pytest

- **Unittest** is built into Python and uses an object-oriented approach with special assert methods.
- **Pytest** needs to be imported and uses a functional approach with simple assert statements.
- **Unittest** automatically detects tests but needs to be run from the command line. **Pytest** runs tests automatically with the `test_` prefix.
- Both can work together; you can use **pytest** with **unittest** code.

Choose based on your preference: **unittest** for built-in simplicity or **pytest** for easier, more readable tests.

### Conclusion

`pytest` is a handy tool for testing Python code. It’s easy to use, has many features, and is well-supported by the community. Ideal for both small and big projects, it helps you write reliable tests quickly.

### Some important concepts regarding testing

1. **Black-box test**:
   - This is a type of testing where the tester doesn’t look at the internal code of the software. They just check if the software works as expected based on inputs and outputs.

2. **Integration test**:
   - This test checks if different parts of the software work well together. It ensures that the combined parts function correctly with each other and with external systems.

3. **Isolation**:
   - In testing, isolation means ensuring that a test only checks one specific part of the software. Any success or failure should be due to the part being tested, not because of something else.

4. **Regression test**:
   - This is a test done after fixing a bug to make sure that the bug doesn’t come back. It checks if the new changes have affected the existing functionality.

5. **Load test**:
   - This type of testing checks how well the software performs under heavy use. It ensures that the software can handle a large number of users or high data loads without crashing.

6. **Smoke test**:
   - This is a basic test to check if the main functions of the software are working. It’s like a quick check to see if the software is stable enough for more detailed testing.

7. **White-box test**:
   - This is a type of testing where the tester looks at the internal code and structure of the software. They check if the internal workings are correct and efficient.

8. **Test-driven development**:
   - This is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. Developers first write a test for a small part of the functionality, then write the code to pass that test, and finally, improve the code while keeping the test passing.
