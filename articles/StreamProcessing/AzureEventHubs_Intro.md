# What is Azure Event Hubs?

Azure Event Hubs is an important service in Azure for processing streaming(real-time/near-real-time) data. In open source we have Kafka. In AWS we have Amazon Kinesis and in Google we have Google Pub/Sub.

Now, let’s be clear: Azure Event Hubs is not Kafka. Kafka is an open-source platform that anyone can set up and run. Azure Event Hubs is a proprietary product by Microsoft. However, Event Hubs offers a Kafka-compatible endpoint, meaning you can use your existing Kafka tools with it if you want.

## How Does Azure Event Hubs Compare to Kafka?

- **Ownership and Control:** With Kafka, you have full control since you’re running it yourself. With Azure Event Hubs, Microsoft manages the service, so you don’t have to worry about maintenance or scaling.
- **Ease of Use:** Event Hubs is easier if you want a managed service without the hassle of setup. Kafka requires you to handle everything from setup to scaling.
- **Integration:** Event Hubs integrates smoothly with other Azure services, making it a good choice if you're already in the Azure ecosystem.

## Why Use Azure Event Hubs?

If you’re looking for a simple, managed solution to handle streaming data, Azure Event Hubs is a solid choice. You don’t need to worry about setting up servers, handling failures, or scaling as your data grows. It’s all taken care of by Azure. Plus, if you’re already using other Azure services, Event Hubs fits right in.

## Can You Use Kafka with Azure Event Hubs?

Yes, you can. Even though Azure Event Hubs isn’t Kafka, it has a Kafka-compatible endpoint. This means you can continue using your Kafka tools and applications with Event Hubs without much change.
