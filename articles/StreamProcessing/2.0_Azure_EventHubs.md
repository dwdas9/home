# What is Azure Event Hubs?

It's like a bridge between Twitter and your Spark cluster. It buffers and forwards the large volume of data that flows from the source to a processing application.

# The confusing "Event Hubs can  stream" statement

As per Microsoft, "Azure Event Hubs is a cloud-native data streaming service that can stream millions of events." Anyone reading this would think Event Hubs streams, i.e., generates some 'live content.' No, it doesn't. Twitter streams. Netflix streams. Azure Event Hubs does not.

The term "stream" means Event Hubs handles the streams, temporarily stores them for some time, and then sends them to Spark (or something similar). Why? If there is no bridge, city would flood. Hence, without the Azure Event Hubs(bridge)

So, "stream" here means "handle and forward" large volumes of data from the source to the destination, not that Event Hubs is the source of the data itself.
