Your approach is sound in terms of using Apache Spark to convert JSON data into the Parquet format. Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for analytical processing tasks. Here's a high-level overview of the approach and some recommendations:

1. **Azure Data Lake**: Using Azure Data Lake (ADLS) to store data is a good choice since it's designed for big data analytics.

2. **Spark Conversion Job**:
   - Your standalone Spark can read files from Azure Data Lake using the `hadoop-azure` package. 
   - Convert the JSON data to a DataFrame and then write it out in Parquet format. 
   - Using Spark allows scalability as your data grows.

3. **Naming Convention**: The naming convention `mm-dd-yy.h.json` is clear in terms of date and hour. However, if you want to further enhance it for easy partitioning later, you might want to consider a directory structure like: `year=yy/month=mm/day=dd/hour=h`. This structure can make partition pruning more efficient during query time if you're using a system like Apache Hive or Delta Lake.

4. **Scheduling**: Scheduling the job at 11.30 PM to ensure the last file is created seems right. You can use Azure Data Factory or even a simple cron job to schedule this.

5. **Improvements & Additional Considerations**:
   - **Delta Lake**: Consider using Delta Lake on top of your Parquet files. Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data lake, ensuring data integrity. It also allows for upserts, deletes, and schema evolution.
   - **Partitioning**: When writing out to Parquet, consider partitioning your data by date or another relevant dimension. This can greatly speed up query performance.
   - **Data Retention**: Think about how long you want to retain the original JSON files after they've been converted. You might want to have a cleanup job to remove older files.
   - **Error Handling**: Ensure that your Spark job has proper error handling and monitoring. This is especially crucial for scheduled jobs.
   - **Incremental Processing**: Instead of converting all files every night, you might want to only process new files. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of processed files or checking timestamps.

Here's a simple Spark code snippet to convert JSON to Parquet:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("json-to-parquet").getOrCreate()

# Assuming you've set up the required configurations to read from ADLS
df = spark.read.json("path_to_adls_json_files")

# Optional: You can repartition data if needed
# df = df.repartition("date_column_name")

df.write.parquet("path_to_save_parquet_files")
```

Remember to handle exceptions and possibly log the process for monitoring and debugging.

If you're planning to scale and deal with a larger volume of data or perform more complex analytics, considering moving to a distributed setup like Databricks or HDInsight Spark in Azure might be beneficial. They provide better management, monitoring, and scalability features.

The error you're seeing, `IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: abfss://weather-timer@strgacweatherapp.dfs.core.windows.net/, expected: file:///`, indicates that Spark is not recognizing the `abfss` scheme and is instead defaulting to the local filesystem (`file:///`).

This is likely because the necessary configurations or dependencies for the `abfss` scheme are not recognized or properly loaded.

Given the persistence of this error, we should attempt an alternative approach.

## Approach using Azure SDK

You can use the Azure SDK to list files in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This approach is more straightforward and should bypass the complexities of configuring Spark with `abfss`.

Here's a Python code example that uses the `azure.storage.filedatalake` package to list the blobs in a container:

```python
from azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClient
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential

# Set up the service client with your ADLS Gen2 account details
account_name = 'strgacweatherapp'
client_id = '026777f8-b65a-4346-aeee-e224d5bf14aa'
client_secret = 'G9E8Q~Rq5g9cufjfM4GDTT6xP1A7_SxMou_00axp'
tenant_id = 'cb5ead41-2c97-4fbc-bafe-d05a91dd6352'

credential = ClientSecretCredential(tenant_id=tenant_id, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)

service_client = DataLakeServiceClient(account_url=f"https://{account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", credential=credential)

# List all blobs in the specified container
file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="weather-timer")
paths = file_system_client.get_paths()

for path in paths:
    print(path.name)
```

Make sure to install the necessary packages:

```
pip install azure-storage-file-datalake azure-identity
```

This code will print the names of all blobs (files and directories) in the specified container. Adjust as necessary for your environment and needs.

I understand your constraints. Given that you're running the code on your machine and not using a platform like Databricks, we should aim for simplicity and directness, while still being efficient. Let's break down the tasks and determine the best tool for each:

1. **Reading/Writing Large Datasets**: 
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark.
    - **Reason**: Spark is designed for distributed data processing. Reading and processing large datasets from ADLS Gen2 into Spark dataframes will be efficient.
    
2. **Listing Files in a Container/Directory**:
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark or Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: PySpark provides simple methods to list files, but if you're already interfacing with Hadoop's FileSystem API for other tasks, it's also a good choice.
    
3. **Renaming or Moving Files**:
    - **Best Tool**: Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: While this can be done with the Azure SDK, the Hadoop FileSystem API provides a more direct interface when working alongside Spark.
    
4. **Creating Containers or Directories**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK (`azure-storage-file-datalake`).
    - **Reason**: Creating containers or directories is a simple storage management task. The Azure SDK provides direct methods to do this without unnecessary overhead.
    
5. **Setting Permissions or Managing Access**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK.
    - **Reason**: Managing permissions or access control is more straightforward with the Azure SDK, which provides methods tailored for these tasks.
    
In summary:

- If your primary tasks involve data processing (e.g., reading, transforming, writing), stick with PySpark.
- For file or directory management within ADLS Gen2 (e.g., renaming, moving, creating directories), the Hadoop FileSystem API is a good choice, especially if you're already using it alongside Spark.
- For tasks that go beyond simple file/directory management, like setting permissions or creating containers, the Azure SDK is more suitable.

Given your constraints and the need for efficiency, this approach strikes a balance between performance and simplicity.
