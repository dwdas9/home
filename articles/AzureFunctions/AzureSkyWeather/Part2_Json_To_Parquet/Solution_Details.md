Your approach is sound in terms of using Apache Spark to convert JSON data into the Parquet format. Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for analytical processing tasks. Here's a high-level overview of the approach and some recommendations:

1. **Azure Data Lake**: Using Azure Data Lake (ADLS) to store data is a good choice since it's designed for big data analytics.

2. **Spark Conversion Job**:
   - Your standalone Spark can read files from Azure Data Lake using the `hadoop-azure` package. 
   - Convert the JSON data to a DataFrame and then write it out in Parquet format. 
   - Using Spark allows scalability as your data grows.

3. **Naming Convention**: The naming convention `mm-dd-yy.h.json` is clear in terms of date and hour. However, if you want to further enhance it for easy partitioning later, you might want to consider a directory structure like: `year=yy/month=mm/day=dd/hour=h`. This structure can make partition pruning more efficient during query time if you're using a system like Apache Hive or Delta Lake.

4. **Scheduling**: Scheduling the job at 11.30 PM to ensure the last file is created seems right. You can use Azure Data Factory or even a simple cron job to schedule this.

5. **Improvements & Additional Considerations**:
   - **Delta Lake**: Consider using Delta Lake on top of your Parquet files. Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data lake, ensuring data integrity. It also allows for upserts, deletes, and schema evolution.
   - **Partitioning**: When writing out to Parquet, consider partitioning your data by date or another relevant dimension. This can greatly speed up query performance.
   - **Data Retention**: Think about how long you want to retain the original JSON files after they've been converted. You might want to have a cleanup job to remove older files.
   - **Error Handling**: Ensure that your Spark job has proper error handling and monitoring. This is especially crucial for scheduled jobs.
   - **Incremental Processing**: Instead of converting all files every night, you might want to only process new files. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of processed files or checking timestamps.

Here's a simple Spark code snippet to convert JSON to Parquet:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("json-to-parquet").getOrCreate()

# Assuming you've set up the required configurations to read from ADLS
df = spark.read.json("path_to_adls_json_files")

# Optional: You can repartition data if needed
# df = df.repartition("date_column_name")

df.write.parquet("path_to_save_parquet_files")
```

Remember to handle exceptions and possibly log the process for monitoring and debugging.

If you're planning to scale and deal with a larger volume of data or perform more complex analytics, considering moving to a distributed setup like Databricks or HDInsight Spark in Azure might be beneficial. They provide better management, monitoring, and scalability features.

The error you're seeing, `IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: abfss://weather-timer@strgacweatherapp.dfs.core.windows.net/, expected: file:///`, indicates that Spark is not recognizing the `abfss` scheme and is instead defaulting to the local filesystem (`file:///`).

This is likely because the necessary configurations or dependencies for the `abfss` scheme are not recognized or properly loaded.

Given the persistence of this error, we should attempt an alternative approach.

## Approach using Azure SDK

You can use the Azure SDK to list files in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This approach is more straightforward and should bypass the complexities of configuring Spark with `abfss`.

Here's a Python code example that uses the `azure.storage.filedatalake` package to list the blobs in a container:

```python
from azure.storage.filedatalake import DataLakeServiceClient
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential

# Set up the service client with your ADLS Gen2 account details
account_name = 'strgacweatherapp'
client_id = '026777f8-b65a-4346-aeee-e224d5bf14aa'
client_secret = 'G9E8Q~Rq5g9cufjfM4GDTT6xP1A7_SxMou_00axp'
tenant_id = 'cb5ead41-2c97-4fbc-bafe-d05a91dd6352'

credential = ClientSecretCredential(tenant_id=tenant_id, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)

service_client = DataLakeServiceClient(account_url=f"https://{account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", credential=credential)

# List all blobs in the specified container
file_system_client = service_client.get_file_system_client(file_system="weather-timer")
paths = file_system_client.get_paths()

for path in paths:
    print(path.name)
```

Make sure to install the necessary packages:

```
pip install azure-storage-file-datalake azure-identity
```

This code will print the names of all blobs (files and directories) in the specified container. Adjust as necessary for your environment and needs.

I understand your constraints. Given that you're running the code on your machine and not using a platform like Databricks, we should aim for simplicity and directness, while still being efficient. Let's break down the tasks and determine the best tool for each:

1. **Reading/Writing Large Datasets**: 
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark.
    - **Reason**: Spark is designed for distributed data processing. Reading and processing large datasets from ADLS Gen2 into Spark dataframes will be efficient.
    
2. **Listing Files in a Container/Directory**:
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark or Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: PySpark provides simple methods to list files, but if you're already interfacing with Hadoop's FileSystem API for other tasks, it's also a good choice.
    
3. **Renaming or Moving Files**:
    - **Best Tool**: Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: While this can be done with the Azure SDK, the Hadoop FileSystem API provides a more direct interface when working alongside Spark.
    
4. **Creating Containers or Directories**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK (`azure-storage-file-datalake`).
    - **Reason**: Creating containers or directories is a simple storage management task. The Azure SDK provides direct methods to do this without unnecessary overhead.
    
5. **Setting Permissions or Managing Access**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK.
    - **Reason**: Managing permissions or access control is more straightforward with the Azure SDK, which provides methods tailored for these tasks.
    
In summary:

- If your primary tasks involve data processing (e.g., reading, transforming, writing), stick with PySpark.
- For file or directory management within ADLS Gen2 (e.g., renaming, moving, creating directories), the Hadoop FileSystem API is a good choice, especially if you're already using it alongside Spark.
- For tasks that go beyond simple file/directory management, like setting permissions or creating containers, the Azure SDK is more suitable.

Given your constraints and the need for efficiency, this approach strikes a balance between performance and simplicity.

The path `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-submit` suggests that this is the location where PySpark was installed as a Python package, likely via `pip` or a similar package manager.

When you install Spark using a package manager like `pip`, it places the Spark binaries and libraries inside the Python's `dist-packages` or `site-packages` directory. This is a different installation approach than downloading and extracting Spark directly from the Apache Spark website.

Here's what you need to know:

1. **SPARK_HOME for pip-installed PySpark**: If you've installed Spark via `pip`, then the equivalent `SPARK_HOME` would be `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/`. This directory would contain all the necessary libraries and dependencies for Spark to run within a Python environment.
2. **Configuration and JARs**: Configuration files, JARs, and other related resources would also be located within this directory structure. For instance, if you're looking for the location to place additional JAR files, it would likely be somewhere like `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/jars/`.
3. **Using `spark-submit`**: The `spark-submit` script in this directory is tailored for the pip-installed Spark and ensures that it picks up the correct libraries and configurations from this location.

In summary, if you've installed Spark using `pip` within your Docker container, then the `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/` directory is your primary point of reference for Spark configurations, binaries, and libraries. This is distinct from a standalone Spark installation, which would typically reside directly under `/usr/local/` or another directory, separate from the Python packages directory.

What if echo $SPARK_HOME or %SPARK_HOME% returns nothing and you are not sure where spark is installed? Even though you instaleld it?

Let's try a different approach.

Spark's binaries (like `spark-submit` and `spark-shell`) are often a good hint as to where Spark might be installed.

1. **Search for Spark binaries**:
   Execute the following command within your Docker container:

   ```bash
   find / -name "spark-submit" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   This command searches for the `spark-submit` binary, which is a common Spark binary. The directory containing this binary is likely your Spark installation directory.

2. Once you've located the directory containing `spark-submit`, you'll typically find Spark's home directory one level up. For instance, if `spark-submit` is found in `/path/to/spark/bin/spark-submit`, then `/path/to/spark` is likely your `SPARK_HOME`.

In my system it returned

`bash
/usr/local/bin/spark-submit
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-submit
`

How do I know where I have installed all the libraries or which is actually the right spark home?

The path `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-submit` suggests that this is the location where PySpark was installed as a Python package, likely via `pip` or a similar package manager.

When you install Spark using a package manager like `pip`, it places the Spark binaries and libraries inside the Python's `dist-packages` or `site-packages` directory. This is a different installation approach than downloading and extracting Spark directly from the Apache Spark website.

Here's what you need to know:

1. **SPARK_HOME for pip-installed PySpark**: If you've installed Spark via `pip`, then the equivalent `SPARK_HOME` would be `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/`. This directory would contain all the necessary libraries and dependencies for Spark to run within a Python environment.
2. **Configuration and JARs**: Configuration files, JARs, and other related resources would also be located within this directory structure. For instance, if you're looking for the location to place additional JAR files, it would likely be somewhere like `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/jars/`.
3. **Using `spark-submit`**: The `spark-submit` script in this directory is tailored for the pip-installed Spark and ensures that it picks up the correct libraries and configurations from this location.

In summary, if you've installed Spark using `pip` within your Docker container, then the `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/` directory is your primary point of reference for Spark configurations, binaries, and libraries. This is distinct from a standalone Spark installation, which would typically reside directly under `/usr/local/` or another directory, separate from the Python packages directory.

To set up the Hadoop configuration and include the necessary JARs for ADLS Gen2 access via Spark, follow these steps:

1. **Include Necessary JARs**:

   When starting your Spark session, you can specify the necessary JAR files using the `--jars` option. 

   For example, if you're starting a Spark shell, you can do:
   ```bash
   $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --jars /path/to/hadoop-azure.jar,/path/to/azure-data-lake-store-sdk.jar,/path/to/hadoop-azure-datalake.jar
   ```

   If you're working with a standalone Python script, you can initialize the Spark session and include the JARs using:
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder \
                       .appName("ADLS Access") \
                       .config("spark.jars", "/path/to/hadoop-azure.jar,/path/to/azure-data-lake-store-sdk.jar,/path/to/hadoop-azure-datalake.jar") \
                       .getOrCreate()
   ```

2. **Set Hadoop Configuration**:

   Once you have your Spark session running with the necessary JARs, set up the Hadoop configuration for ADLS Gen2 access:

   ```python
   # Set Hadoop configurations for ADLS Gen2 access
   hadoop_conf = spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration()
   hadoop_conf.set("fs.azure", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azure.NativeAzureFileSystem")
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.key.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", "YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY")
   ```

   If you're using Service Principal authentication (which seems to be your case):
   ```python
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.auth.type.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", "OAuth")
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider")
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", "YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET")
   hadoop_conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint.{storage_account_name}.dfs.core.windows.net", f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{YOUR_TENANT_ID}/oauth2/token")
   ```

3. **Proceed with Your Code**:
   
   After setting up the Hadoop configuration, you should be able to run the rest of your code to list or restructure files in ADLS Gen2.

Make sure you replace placeholders like `YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY`, `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUR_TENANT_ID`, and paths to JAR files with the actual values.

This should help you set up the Hadoop configuration and include the necessary JARs for ADLS Gen2 access via Spark.
