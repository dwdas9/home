1. **Azure Data Lake**: Using Azure Data Lake (ADLS) to store data is a good choice since it's designed for big data analytics.
2. **Spark Conversion Job**:
   - Your standalone Spark can read files from Azure Data Lake using the `hadoop-azure` package. 
   - Convert the JSON data to a DataFrame and then write it out in Parquet format. 
   - Using Spark allows scalability as your data grows.
3. **Naming Convention**: The naming convention `mm-dd-yy.h.json` is clear in terms of date and hour. However, if you want to further enhance it for easy partitioning later, you might want to consider a directory structure like: `year=yy/month=mm/day=dd/hour=h`. This structure can make partition pruning more efficient during query time if you're using a system like Apache Hive or Delta Lake.
4. **Scheduling**: Scheduling the job at 11.30 PM to ensure the last file is created seems right. You can use Azure Data Factory or even a simple cron job to schedule this.
5. **Improvements & Additional Considerations**:
   - **Delta Lake**: Consider using Delta Lake on top of your Parquet files. Delta Lake brings ACID transactions to your data lake, ensuring data integrity. It also allows for upserts, deletes, and schema evolution.
   - **Partitioning**: When writing out to Parquet, consider partitioning your data by date or another relevant dimension. This can greatly speed up query performance.
   - **Data Retention**: Think about how long you want to retain the original JSON files after they've been converted. You might want to have a cleanup job to remove older files.
   - **Error Handling**: Ensure that your Spark job has proper error handling and monitoring. This is especially crucial for scheduled jobs.
   - **Incremental Processing**: Instead of converting all files every night, you might want to only process new files. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of processed files or checking timestamps.

1. **Reading/Writing Large Datasets**: 
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark.
    - **Reason**: Spark is designed for distributed data processing. Reading and processing large datasets from ADLS Gen2 into Spark dataframes will be efficient.
    
2. **Listing Files in a Container/Directory**:
    - **Best Tool**: PySpark or Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: PySpark provides simple methods to list files, but if you're already interfacing with Hadoop's FileSystem API for other tasks, it's also a good choice.
    
3. **Renaming or Moving Files**:
    - **Best Tool**: Hadoop FileSystem API.
    - **Reason**: While this can be done with the Azure SDK, the Hadoop FileSystem API provides a more direct interface when working alongside Spark.
    
4. **Creating Containers or Directories**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK (`azure-storage-file-datalake`).
    - **Reason**: Creating containers or directories is a simple storage management task. The Azure SDK provides direct methods to do this without unnecessary overhead.
    
5. **Setting Permissions or Managing Access**:
    - **Best Tool**: Azure SDK.
    - **Reason**: Managing permissions or access control is more straightforward with the Azure SDK, which provides methods tailored for these tasks.
    
In summary:

- If your primary tasks involve data processing (e.g., reading, transforming, writing), stick with PySpark.
- For file or directory management within ADLS Gen2 (e.g., renaming, moving, creating directories), the Hadoop FileSystem API is a good choice, especially if you're already using it alongside Spark.
- For tasks that go beyond simple file/directory management, like setting permissions or creating containers, the Azure SDK is more suitable.
