# <span style="color: DodgerBlue;">Setting Up a Local Kafka Development Environment with Docker Compose </span>


<p style="color: #006600; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-left: 5px solid #00cc66;">
In this guide, I'll walk through setting up a local Kafka development environment using Docker Compose. The provided `docker-compose` file sets up all the necessary components, including Kafka broker, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, Control Center, ksqlDB, and a REST Proxy. I have tested the installation in both Windows and Mac machines with M1 chip.
</p>

## <span style="color: BlueViolet;">Prerequisites</span>
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

## <span style="color: ForestGreen;">Download the Docker Compose file</span>

To get started with setting up Confluent Platform, you'll need the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file contains all the necessary configurations to run Confluent Platform services using Docker.

Here's what you need to do:

1. Click this [link](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/7.5.1-post/cp-all-in-one-kraft/docker-compose.yml) to access KRaft version of the `docker-compose.yml` file on GitHub.

Note: When choosing between KRaft and ZooKeeper as the metadata service for your Apache Kafka cluster, **KRaft** is the **recommended** option.

2. Copy the content of the file and paste it in a text file and rename it to docker-compose.yml(remove the .txt ext)

**Remember**: The container group will be named after the folder containing the docker-compose. I.e. If it is inside London/docker-compose.yml then the container group in docker will be London.

## <span style="color: Teal;">Steps to Launch the Kafka Environment</span>

1. Open command prompt/terminal and CD to the folder containing the `docker-compose.yml`

2. Run the following command to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. The Docker Compose will start all the necessary services in the background. Once finished, go to the docker desktop window and see the services

5. You can access the Control Center at http://localhost:9021 once the container is operational.
6. To create topics and proceed further you can refer to the  this quickstart [guide](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/platform-quickstart.html#cp-quickstart-step-1).

### <span style="color: DimGray;">Error: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8</span>

We might run into an error like no matching manifest for linux/arm65/v8 this error error indicates that the Docker images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file do not have a version compatible with the architecture of our Mac's processor. This error is less likely if you use the KRaft version. I have tested the KRaft versin on both Windows and Mac M1, they both showed no error in architecture or compatibility.

1. **Update `docker-compose.yml`**: At the time of writing this article I couldn't find any ARM-compatible imageges. However, in future if you find ARM64-compatible images, update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use those images instead of the default ones.

2. **Use Platform Emulation (if available)**: Docker Desktop for Mac with Apple Silicon has the ability to emulate AMD64 architecture images. To enable this, add the `platform: linux/amd64` directive under the service in the `docker-compose.yml` file. However, note, this is still like a workaround and doesn't guarantee error-free future. Here's an example for one service:

   ```yaml
   services:
     zookeeper:
       image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
       platform: linux/amd64
       # ... rest of the configuration ...
   ```

   Repeat this for each service defined in your Docker Compose file.


### <span style="color: DimGray;">Resolving Port Conflicts for Kafka Rest Proxy in Docker</span> 

When deploying Kafka Rest Proxy using Docker Compose, port conflicts are a common issue that can prevent the service from starting successfully. 

![Alt text](image-2.png)

Here is a typical example of this error:

```bash
Cannot start Docker Compose application. Reason: compose [start] exit status 1. Container broker Starting Container broker Started Container schema-registry Starting Container schema-registry Started Container rest-proxy Starting Container connect Starting Container connect Started Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:8082 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:8082: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
```

**Long story short:** Use this  [modified docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) which uses port **8086** instead of **8082**

**Detailed investigation**:

1. **Identify Port Usage**: Use `netstat` or `lsof` to check if the intended port is already in use.

   - For Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :<PORT>`
   - For Linux/Mac: `sudo lsof -i :<PORT>` or `sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :<PORT>`

      ![Alt text](image-3.png)

2. **Modify Docker Compose File**: If the port is in use, select an unused port and update the `docker-compose.yml` file. Change the host port mapping for the `rest-proxy` service:

   ```yaml
   ports:
     - <UNUSED_PORT>:8082 # Change <UNUSED_PORT> to an available port on your host
   ```

   e.g:

    ![Alt text](image-5.png)

3. **Restart Docker Compose**: Apply the changes by running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Update Applications**: Ensure all applications that interact with Kafka Rest Proxy are updated to use the new port.

### <span style="color: DimGray;">About the docker-compose.yml</span> 

Here is an explanation of the differnet services in the docker-compose.yml

- **broker**: A Kafka broker service with custom environment configurations for topics, listeners, ports, IDs, etc.
- **schema-registry**: This service provides a serving layer for your metadata. It is configured to communicate with the Kafka broker and expose port 8081.
- **connect**: Kafka Connect with dependencies on the broker and schema-registry, configured to run connectors.
- **control-center**: Confluent's web-based tool for managing and monitoring the Kafka ecosystem.
- **ksqldb-server**: The server for ksqlDB, streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka.
- **ksqldb-cli**: A command-line interface for interacting with ksqlDB Server.
- **ksql-datagen**: A tool for generating sample data for Kafka topics and provides a source of continuously flowing data.
- **rest-proxy**: Provides a RESTful interface to Kafka clusters.

Each service is configured with specific environment variables necessary for its operation, ports for external access, and volume mounts where applicable. Some services depend on others, which is defined by the `depends_on` attribute ensuring that dependent services are started first.

The setup may be sufficient for a dev environment as it has a single replica for Kafka and the use of local hostnames. The `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` and other network-related configurations are set up to allow the services to communicate both internally and with the host machine.

### <span style="color: PaleVioletRed;">Conclusion</span>

You now have a fully functional local Kafka development environment that includes a broker, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, Control Center, ksqlDB, and a REST Proxy. The KRaft version of the docker compose has been tested in both WIndows and Mac M1 machines.
