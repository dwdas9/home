ðŸ“Œ **You have a Fabric workspace that contains a lakehouse named Lakehouse1. A user named User1 plans to use Lakehouse explorer to read Lakehouse1 data. You need to assign a workspace role to User1. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which workspace role should you assign to User1?**

- Admin

- Contributor

- Member

- Viewer

- **Answer:** <span style="color: white">To read the data from a Fabric lakehouse by using Lakehouse explorer, users must be assigned roles of either Admin, Member, or Contributor. However, respecting the least privileged principle, a user must be assigned the Contributor role. The viewer role does not provide permission to read the lakehouse data through Lakehouse explorer.</span>

ðŸ“Œ **You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named Workspace1. Workspace1 contains a lakehouse, a data pipeline, a notebook, and several Microsoft Power BI reports. A user named User1 plans to use SQL to access the lakehouse to analyze data. User1 must have the following access: User1 must have read-only access to the lakehouse. User1 must NOT be able to access the rest of the items in Workspace1. User1 must NOT be able to use Spark to query the underlying files in the lakehouse. You need to configure access for User1. What should you do?**

- Add User1 to the workspace as a member, share the lakehouse with User1, and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.

- Add User1 to the workspace as a viewer, share the lakehouse with User1, and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.

- Share the lakehouse with User1 directly and select Build reports on the default dataset.

- Share the lakehouse with User1 directly and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.

- **Answer:** <span style="color: white">Since the user only needs access to the lakehouse and not the other items in the workspace, you should share the lakehouse directly and select Read all SQL Endpoint data. The user should not be added as a member of the workspace. All members of the workspace, even viewers, will be able to open all Power BI reports in the workspace. The SQL analytics endpoint itself cannot be shared directly; the Share options only show for the lakehouse.</span>

ðŸ“Œ **You use Microsoft Power BI Desktop to create a Power BI semantic model. You need to recommend a solution to collaborate with another Power BI modeler. The solution must ensure that you can both work on different parts of the model simultaneously. The solution must provide the most efficient and productive way to collaborate on the same model. What should you recommend?**

- Save your work as a PBIX file and email the file to the other modeler.

- Save your work as a PBIX file and publish the file to a Fabric workspace. Add the other modeler as member to the workspace.

- Save your work as a PBIX file to Microsoft OneDrive and share the file with the other modeler.

- Save your work as a Power BI Project (PBIP). Initialize a Git repository with version control.

- **Answer:** <span style="color: white">Saving your Power BI work as a PBIP enables you to save the work as individual plain text files in a simple, intuitive folder structure, which can be checked into a source control system such as Git. This will enable multiple developers to work on different parts of the model simultaneously. Emailing a Power BI model back and forth is not efficient for collaboration. Saving a Power BI model as a PBIX file to OneDrive eases developers access, but only one developer can have the file open at time. Publishing a PBIX file to a shared workspace does not allow multiple developers to work on the model simultaneously.</span>

ðŸ“Œ **You have a semantic model that pulls data from an Azure SQL database and is synced via Fabric deployment pipelines to three workspaces named Development, Test, and Production. You need to reduce the

 size of the dataset. Which DAX function should you use to remove unused columns?**

- SELECTCOLUMNS()

- KEEPFILTERS()

- ADDCOLUMNS()

- REMOVECOLUMNS()

- **Answer:** <span style="color: white">Use the SELECTCOLUMNS() function to select columns from a table while preserving the table structure. REMOVECOLUMNS() also removes columns from a table, but should be used only for columns that are not referenced anywhere else in the semantic model.</span>


ðŸ“Œ **What is the most cost-effective approach to move data from Azure Data Lake Storage to a lakehouse in Fabric?**

- Use the built-in Data Factory in Fabric to move the data.

- Use a Dataflow Gen2 to move the data.

- Use a Power BI Dataflow to move the data.

- Use a Spark Notebook to move the data.

- **Answer:** <span style="color: white">Using a built-in Data Factory in Fabric can be a cost-effective approach to move the data, providing an integrated and seamless way to handle data transfer within the same platform.</span>

You are planning a Fabric analytics solution.

You need to recommend a licensing strategy to support 10 Microsoft Power BI report authors and 600 report consumers.
The solution must use Dataflow Gen2 for data ingestion and minimize costs.
Which Fabric license type should you recommend? Select only one answer.

F16
F32
F64
Premium Per User (PPU)

Answer: While F32 and F16 license types will provide all the necessary set of features, these licenses are not cost-efficient because report consumers require a Pro or PPU license. Starting with the F64 license, report consumers can use a free per-user license. PPU is incorrect, because you cannot create non-Power BI items (in this case Dataflow Gen2) with PPU.
---
You are planning a Fabric analytics solution for the following users:

2,000 Microsoft Power BI consumers without an individual Power BI Pro license.
32 Power BI modelers with an individual Power BI Pro license.
16 data scientists
You need to recommend a Fabric capacity SKU. The solution must minimize costs.

What should you recommend?

Select only one answer.

F2
F2048
F32
F64

Answer: F64 is the smallest Fabric capacity (equivalent to a P1 Power BI Premium capacity) that supports premium Fabric workspaces and does not require Power BI report consumers to have individual Power BI Pro licenses. F2 and F32 are incorrect since they require that the 2,000 employees have individual Power BI Pro licenses to consume Power BI content. F2048 is incorrect since it is not the smallest capacity that meets the stated requirements.

You are planning the configuration of a new Fabric tenant.

You need to recommend a solution to ensure that reports meet the following requirements:

Require authentication for embedded reports.
Allow only read-only (live) connections against Fabric capacity cloud semantic models.
Which two actions should you recommend performing from the Fabric admin portal? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.

From Capacity settings, set XMLA Endpoint to Read Write.

From Embed Codes, delete all existing codes.

From Premium Per User, set XMLA Endpoint to Off.

From Tenant settings, disable Allow XMLA endpoints and Analyze in Excel with on-premises semantic models.

From Tenant settings, disable Publish to web.

Answer: Disabling Publish to web disables the ability to publish any unsecured (no login required) reports to any embedded location. Disabling XMLA Endpoints ensures that semantic models can be connected to, but not edited directly in, workspaces.

You use Microsoft Power BI Desktop to create a Power BI semantic model.

You need to recommend a solution to collaborate with another Power BI modeler. The solution must ensure that you can both work on different parts of the model simultaneously. The solution must provide the most efficient and productive way to collaborate on the same model.

What should you recommend?

Save your work as a PBIX file and email the file to the other modeler.

Save your work as a PBIX file and publish the file to a Fabric workspace. Add the other modeler as member to the workspace.

Save your work as a PBIX file to Microsoft OneDrive and share the file with the other modeler.

Save your work as a Power BI Project (PBIP). Initialize a Git repository with version control.

Answer: Saving your Power BI work as a PBIP enables you to save the work as individual plain text files in a simple, intuitive folder structure, which can be checked into a source control system such as Git. This will enable multiple developers to work on different parts of the model simultaneously.

Emailing a Power BI model back and forth is not efficient for collaboration. Saving a Power BI model as a PBIX file to OneDrive eases developers access, but only one developer can have the file open at time. Publishing a PBIX file to a shared workspace does not allow multiple developers to work on the model simultaneously.

You have a Fabric tenant that has XMLA Endpoint set to Read Write.

You need to use the XMLA endpoint to deploy changes to only one table from the data model.

What is the main limitation of using XMLA endpoints for the Microsoft Power BI deployment process?

Select only one answer.

A PBIX file cannot be downloaded from the Power BI service.
Only the user that deployed the report can make changes.
Table partitioning is impossible.
You cannot use parameters for incremental refresh.

Answer: 
Whenever the semantic model is deployed/changed by using XMLA endpoints, there is no possibility to download the PBIX file from the Power BI service. This means that no one can download the PBIX file (even the user who deployed the report). Table partitioning, as well as using parameters, is still supported, thus doesnâ€™t represent a limitation.
---
You have an Azure SQL database that contains a customer dimension table. The table contains two columns named CustomerID and CustomerCompositeKey.

You have a Fabric workspace that contains a Dataflow Gen2 query that connects to the database.

You need to use Dataflows Query Editor to identify which of the two columns contains non-duplicate values per customer.

Which option should you use?

Select only one answer.

Column distribution â€“ distinct values
Column distribution â€“ unique values
Column profile â€“ values count
Column quality â€“ valid values
Answer: Only the distinct values displayed under Column distribution will show the true number of rows of values that are distinct (one row per value). The count of unique only shows the number of distinct values that are in the first 1,000 rows, and the other two options do not review uniqueness

---
You have a Fabric workspace that contains a lakehouse named Lakehouse1.

A user named User1 plans to use Lakehouse explorer to read Lakehouse1 data.

You need to assign a workspace role to User1. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege.

Which workspace role should you assign to User1?

Select only one answer.

Admin

Contributor

Member

Viewer
To read the data from a Fabric lakehouse by using Lakehouse explorer, users must be assigned roles of either Admin, Member, or Contributor. However, respecting the least privileged principle, a user must be assigned the Contributor role. The viewer role does not provide permission to read the lakehouse data through Lakehouse explorer.

**Question:**

You are developing a large semantic model.

You have a fact table that contains 500 million rows. Most analytic queries will target aggregated data, but some users must still be able to view data on a detailed level.

You plan to create a composite model and implement user-defined aggregations.

Which three storage modes should you use for each type of table? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

Select all answers that apply.
- Aggregated tables should use Dual mode.
- Aggregated tables should use Import mode.
- The detailed fact table should use DirectQuery mode.
- The detailed fact table should use Import mode.
- Dimension tables should use DirectQuery mode.
- Dimension tables should use Dual mode.

**Answer:**
- Aggregated tables should use Import mode.
- The detailed fact table should use DirectQuery mode.
- Dimension tables should use Dual mode.

**Explanation:** 
When using user-defined aggregations, the detailed fact table must be in DirectQuery mode. It is recommended to set the storage mode to Import for aggregated tables because of the performance, while dimension tables should be set to Dual mode to avoid the limitations of limited relationships
