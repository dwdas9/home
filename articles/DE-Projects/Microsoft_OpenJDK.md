# <span style="color: #7A3DAA; font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Installing Microsoft OpenJDK</span>

There are many versions of JDK. Refer to the table at the end to see them. Here we will focus on OpenJDK. Many popular applications and platforms use OpenJDK as their Java runtime. For example, **Minecraft (Java Edition)**, **Apache Cassandra**, **Apache Kafka**, **Jenkins**, and **ElasticSearch** all rely on OpenJDK. Development tools like **IntelliJ IDEA** and **Eclipse** also run well on it. **Spring Boot applications**, **Atlassian** products like **Jira** and **Confluence**, big data tools like **Apache Hadoop** and **Apache Spark**, as well as **Docker images** and web servers like **Apache Tomcat** and **Jetty**, commonly use OpenJDK. Even **Android Studio** can run with OpenJDK. So, OpenJDK is used a lot in  real-world applications.

In this article I will give you a brief intro to Microsoft OpenJDK and how to install it.

Microsoft also says their OpenJDK can replace any OpenJDK, even in non-Microsoft environments like AWS + Linux. Plus, their version has extra fixes and enhancements, making it work better in the Microsoft ecosystem.
