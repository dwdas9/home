## My Approach
### **1. Data Collection**
   - **Source Forex Data**: I will use one of the free Forex APIs mentioned earlier (like Alpha Vantage, CurrencyLayer, or Free Forex API) to collect real-time and historical currency exchange rate data.
   - **Additional Data**: I’ll consider integrating other data sources like economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, inflation data), news feeds (using APIs like NewsAPI), and social sentiment (from Twitter API).

### **2. Data Processing**
   - **Stream Data to Kafka**: I’ll set up a Kafka pipeline to stream live Forex data into my system, ensuring that the data is continuously updated.
   - **Data Storage**: I’ll use a database like PostgreSQL or a time-series database like InfluxDB to store historical data for analysis.

### **3. AI Model Development**
   - **Feature Engineering**: I’ll extract useful features from the data, such as currency pair volatility, moving averages, or sentiment scores.
   - **Model Selection**: I plan to use machine learning models like **Random Forests**, **Gradient Boosting**, or **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks for predicting currency price trends.
   - **Training the Model**: I’ll use historical data to train my AI models to predict future currency movements, possibly using platforms like **Azure Machine Learning** or **TensorFlow**.
   - **Model Evaluation**: I’ll regularly evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### **4. AI-Powered Suggestions**
   - **Decision Logic**: Based on the model’s predictions, I’ll develop logic that suggests which currency to buy. This could be as simple as recommending currencies predicted to appreciate or a more complex strategy considering multiple factors.
   - **User Input**: I’ll allow users to input preferences or constraints (e.g., risk tolerance, preferred currency pairs).

### **5. Dashboard Development**
   - **Visualization**: I’ll use tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or **Grafana** to create interactive visualizations of Forex trends, AI predictions, and suggested trades.
   - **Integration**: I’ll integrate the AI model’s output into the dashboard to provide real-time trading recommendations.
   - **User Interface**: I’ll ensure the dashboard is user-friendly, displaying key metrics like predicted price changes, confidence levels, and suggested trades clearly.

### **6. Deployment**
   - **Web Hosting**: I’ll host the dashboard on a cloud platform like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.
   - **Monitoring**: I’ll implement monitoring for both the data pipeline and AI models to ensure everything runs smoothly and the predictions remain accurate.

### **7. Continuous Improvement**
   - **Feedback Loop**: I’ll collect user feedback and actual market outcomes to continuously improve the AI model.
   - **Model Retraining**: I’ll regularly retrain the model with new data to keep it up-to-date with the latest market conditions.

**In short**: I’ll be streaming real-time Forex data, processing it with AI to predict currency movements, and presenting these insights in a user-friendly dashboard that suggests which currencies to buy based on the model’s predictions.
