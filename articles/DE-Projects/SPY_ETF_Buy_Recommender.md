### **Requirement Document: ETF SPY Recommendation App**

#### **Objective:**
I want to create an app that provides buy or not recommendations specifically for the ETF SPY, based on real-time data analysis and AI-driven insights.

#### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Data Sources:**
   - **ETF SPY Data**: The app should collect historical and real-time data for SPY, including prices, trading volume, dividend history, and expense ratios.
   - **Market Sentiment Data**: The app should gather sentiment data from financial news, social media platforms like Twitter, and forums like Reddit to gauge market mood towards SPY.
   - **Macroeconomic Data**: The app should also consider macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth that could impact SPY’s performance.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the data, such as moving averages, RSI, sentiment scores, and other technical indicators.
   - **Data Storage**: The app should store collected data in a database, ensuring it is updated in real-time.

3. **AI Model Development:**
   - **Model Selection**: The app should use machine learning models, like Random Forests or Neural Networks, to analyze the data and make predictions.
   - **Training and Evaluation**: The model should be trained on historical data and regularly updated with new data. It should also be evaluated for accuracy using backtesting techniques.

4. **Recommendation Logic:**
   - **Buy or Not Decision**: Based on the AI model’s predictions and market sentiment analysis, the app should provide a simple buy or not recommendation.
   - **User Personalization**: Allow users to input their risk tolerance and investment goals, which will tailor the recommendations.

5. **User Interface:**
   - **Dashboard**: The app should have a clean and user-friendly dashboard displaying SPY’s current status, AI-driven recommendations, and key metrics.
   - **Alerts**: Users should receive notifications or alerts when a significant change in recommendation occurs.

6. **Deployment:**
   - **Cloud Hosting**: The app should be hosted on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure to ensure scalability and reliability.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: The app should integrate with data sources via APIs to provide real-time updates and recommendations.

### **Solutioning Document: ETF SPY Recommendation App**

#### **1. Data Collection:**
   - **APIs**: I will use **Yahoo Finance API** for fetching SPY’s financial data, including prices, volume, and dividends. For market sentiment, I’ll use the **Twitter API** and **NewsAPI** to gather social media and news sentiment on SPY.
   - **Data Pipeline**: I’ll set up a data pipeline using **Apache Kafka** to stream real-time data from these sources into my app’s backend.

#### **2. Data Processing:**
   - **Feature Engineering**: I’ll extract technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and volatility from SPY’s historical data. Sentiment analysis will be performed on the collected news and social media data using NLP tools.
   - **Database**: I’ll store all processed data in a **PostgreSQL** database, ensuring real-time updates with proper indexing for quick access.

#### **3. AI Model Development:**
   - **Model Selection**: I’ll start with a **Random Forest** model for its robustness and ability to handle different types of data. I might also experiment with **LSTM** networks for better time-series predictions.
   - **Training and Evaluation**: I’ll use historical SPY data to train the model and backtest it against past market conditions to ensure accuracy.

#### **4. Recommendation Logic:**
   - **Buy or Not Decision**: The model’s output, combined with sentiment scores, will feed into a decision-making algorithm. If the model predicts positive returns and sentiment is high, the app will recommend a buy; otherwise, it will advise holding off.
   - **User Personalization**: I’ll add options for users to set their risk levels and investment preferences, which will adjust the final recommendation accordingly.

#### **5. User Interface:**
   - **Dashboard Design**: I’ll create a dashboard using **React** for the frontend, showing SPY’s current data, AI predictions, and a clear buy/not recommendation. I’ll also include charts and graphs for better visualization.
   - **Alerts**: I’ll implement real-time notifications using **Firebase Cloud Messaging** to alert users when the recommendation changes.

#### **6. Deployment:**
   - **Cloud Hosting**: I’ll deploy the app on **AWS**, using services like **EC2** for hosting the application and **RDS** for the PostgreSQL database.
   - **Real-Time Integration**: The app will be connected to all data sources via APIs to ensure it provides up-to-the-minute recommendations.
