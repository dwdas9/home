## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">**For the busy people:**</span>
- **Development**: **Minikube**, **K3d**, **Docker Desktop Kubernetes**, and **Kind** are geared toward development and testing.
- **Production**: **Kubeadm**, **Rancher**, **K3s**, and managed services like **Amazon EKS**, **Google GKE**, and **Azure AKS** are suited for production environments.
- **Mixed Use**: **K3s** and **MicroK8s** can be used both in development and production, especially in edge computing and IoT.
