## Example 1: Basic CI Pipeline
This example shows a simple CI pipeline that runs tests on every push to the main branch.

**Workflow YAML:**

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

**Explanation:**
- **on: push:** Triggers the workflow on pushes to the main branch.
- **jobs:** Defines the job that will run.
- **steps:** Lists the steps to be executed, such as checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, and running tests.

## Example 2: CI/CD Pipeline with Deployment
This example shows a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a Node.js application to an Azure App Service.

**Workflow YAML:**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: 'my-web-app'
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
          package: .
```

**Explanation:**
- **on: push:** Triggers the workflow on pushes to the main branch.
- **jobs:** Defines the job that will run.
- **steps:** Lists the steps to be executed, including checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, running tests, building the project, and deploying to Azure Web App.
- **secrets:** Securely stores sensitive information like the Azure publish profile.

## Example 3: Scheduled Workflow
This example demonstrates a workflow that runs tests every day at midnight.

**Workflow YAML:**

```yaml
name: Scheduled Test Run

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

**Explanation:**
- **on: schedule:** Triggers the workflow based on a cron schedule (every day at midnight).
- **jobs:** Defines the job that will run.
- **steps:** Lists the steps to be executed, such as checking out the code, setting up Python, installing dependencies, and running tests.

## Example 4: Multi-Environment Deployment
This example shows how to deploy to different environments (staging and production) based on the branch.

**Workflow YAML:**

```yaml
name: Multi-Environment Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - staging

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        environment: [staging, production]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Azure Web App
        uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: ${{ matrix.environment == 'production' && 'my-web-app-prod' || 'my-web-app-staging' }}
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE_${{ matrix.environment | upper }} }}
          package: .
```

**Explanation:**
- **on: push:** Triggers the workflow on pushes to the main and staging branches.
- **strategy: matrix:** Defines a matrix strategy to run the job for both staging and production environments.
- **steps:** Lists the steps to be executed, including checking out the code, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, running tests, building the project, and deploying to Azure Web App.
- **conditional logic:** Uses conditional logic to deploy to the appropriate environment based on the branch.
