## <span style="color: MediumOrchid;Font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;">Understanding GitHub Actions</span>

In this article, I'll explain the core concepts of GitHub Actions.

### <span style="color: PaleVioletRed ">For the Busy Readers</span>

GitHub Actions is a tool to automate code building and deployment tasks. With GitHub Actions, you create **workflows**. These workflows are YAML files inside the `.github/workflows` folder in your project. Workflows contain jobs, and jobs contain steps. Steps can be simple commands, scripts, or pre-built actions from the GitHub community.

**Another explanation:**

GitHub Actions is a GitHub feature that lets you run tasks when certain events happen in your code repository. You can use it to trigger any part of a CI/CD pipeline using webhooks on GitHub.

GitHub Actions offers over 13,000 pre-written and tested CI/CD workflows. You can also write your own workflows or customize existing ones using YAML files.

GitHub Actions is not just for CI/CD pipelines. Here are some other uses:

- Running nightly builds in the master branch for testing.
- Cleaning up old issues or bug reports.
- Creating bots that respond to comments or commands on pull requests or issues.

In short, GitHub Actions is the GitHub feature that automates CI/CD and more.

### <span style="color: PaleVioletRed ">Key Concepts in GitHub Actions</span>

Here are the key terms you will hear most of the time when dealing with GitHub Actions:

1. **Workflows**: YAML files inside the `.github/workflows` folder.
2. **Jobs**: Workflows contain jobs, which are sets of steps.
3. **Steps**: Jobs are made up of steps that run commands, scripts, or actions.
4. **Runners**: Servers that execute the jobs (can be GitHub-provided or self-hosted).

**How It Works:**
1. **Trigger**: An event, like pushing code or creating a pull request, triggers the workflow.
2. **Workflow Activation**: The specified workflow for that trigger starts running.
3. **Jobs Execution**: Jobs within the workflow run, either independently or in sequence.
4. **Runners**: Jobs use virtual machines provided by GitHub or self-hosted machines to run.

### <span style="color: PaleVioletRed">Example Workflow</span>
You commit code to your repository. The workflow is triggered. Your code is built, tested, and deployed automatically.

> GitHub provides virtual machines for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### <span style="color: PaleVioletRed">Anatomy of a GitHub Workflow</span>

A GitHub Actions workflow is written as a YAML file inside the `.github/workflows` directory of a project/repository. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository.

This is how a typical workflow YAML file looks:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build
      run: make build
```

1. **name**: This workflow is named "CI" (Continuous Integration). You can name it anything you like.
2. **on**: This workflow runs when there is a push to the `main` branch.
3. **jobs**: This workflow has one job named `build`.
4. **runs-on**: This job runs on an `ubuntu-latest` virtual machine.
5. **steps**: 
    - **Checkout code**: Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to pull the code.
    - **Build**: Runs the `make build` command to build the project.
