## <span style="color: CadetBlue">A very simplistic introduction</span>

Copying data is one of the main activity in Synapse and ADF. The main tool to do this **Integration Runtime** is used. It's like a **bridge** that connects Synapse and ADF with data from on-premises and external sources.

However, it's more than just a bridge. It provides the CPU and memory needed for copying and transforming data. It also offers an environment to run your SSIS packages. It can scale up or down if more power is needed. Plus, it ensures that your data transfer is secure.

Where is IR used? It is used in ADF/Synapse pipelines.

## <span style="color: Navy">Types of Integration Runtime</span>

There are three types of Integration runtime.

### <span style="color: BlueViolet">1. Azure Integration Runtime:</span>

## <span style="color: DarkCyan">Self-hosted IR vs On-premises Data Gateway</span>

The on-premise gateway is quite similar to the self-hosted IR. Are they the same? Can they be used interchangeably? The table below provides the answers:

## <span style="color: Chocolate">Summary</span>

Azure Integration Runtime (IR) is a key tool in ADF and Azure Synapse Analytics. It helps move and transform data between different places, like from your on-premises servers to the cloud or within the cloud itself. Azure IR provides the computing power needed to handle these tasks efficiently. Without it, moving and preparing data for analysis would be difficult, slow, and require a lot more manual work.
