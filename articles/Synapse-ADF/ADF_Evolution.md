### What is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a popular ETL tool. This means it lets you import data, clean and transform it, and then export it to another system. Let’s see how it started and how it improved over the last decade.

### Early Version of Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory was first introduced on October 28th, 2014, and became fully available on August 6th, 2015. Initially, it was good at handling time-based data processing but didn’t have many features. In the early days, you had to edit a lot of JSON files and use Visual Studio for development, which was not very user-friendly.

### Major Updates in Azure Data Factory

A major update happened at Microsoft Ignite 2017.

On September 25th, 2017, Azure Data Factory version 2 (ADF v2) was introduced. This version had many new features, making it much better than before. Key improvements included:

- **SSIS Integration:** You could now move your existing SSIS packages to Azure.
- **Advanced Features:** New features like looping, branching, and scheduling pipelines based on the clock were added.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** On January 16th, 2018, new visual tools with drag-and-drop features were added, making it much easier to use.

These new features were officially released on June 27th, 2018.

### Azure Data Factory Today

The ADF you see today is actually ADF v2. The old version is mostly forgotten. ADF v2 is now a full-fledged tool that can handle entire projects on its own.
