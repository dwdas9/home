## What is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a popular tool for managing data. This article explains what ADF was before and how it has improved over time.

### Early Version of Azure Data Factory
Azure Data Factory was first introduced to the public on October 28th, 2014, and became fully available on August 6th, 2015. Initially, it was designed to handle time-based data processing, which it did well. However, it wasn't as feature-rich as SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). In the early days, you had to do a lot of JSON editing and use Visual Studio for development, which was not very user-friendly.

### Major Updates in Azure Data Factory
A major upgrade happened at Microsoft Ignite 2017.

On September 25th, 2017, Azure Data Factory version 2 (ADF v2) was introduced. This version brought many new features, making it almost a new product. Key improvements included:
- **SSIS Integration**: You could now move your existing SSIS packages to Azure.
- **Advanced Features**: New features like looping, branching, and scheduling pipelines based on the clock were added.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: On January 16th, 2018, new visual tools with drag-and-drop features were added, making it much easier to use.

These new features were officially released on June 27th, 2018.

### Azure Data Factory Today
Today, when we talk about "Azure Data Factory," we mean this enhanced version 2. The old version is mostly forgotten. ADF v2 is known for its advanced features and easy-to-use interface, showing how much it has improved over the years.
