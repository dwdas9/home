Back in the older days, people didn't pay much attention to data engineering. But then, tools like SQL Server Integration Service made things a bit easier. Even though this tool let us bring in data from different sources, like files, its main job was to move data into SQL Server. Then Azure Data Factory showed up.

Azure Data Factory(ADF), really has come a long way. It started off pretty simple, just helping move data from here to there in the cloud. But now? It's a full-on powerhouse, making complex data movement and transformations. Let's take a quick walk through how it got from point A to point B:

| Period       | Milestone                                           | Key Features                                                                                                                                                      |

| Pre-2015     | Before ADF                                          | Data integration handled by on-premises solutions like SSIS. Cloud-based data integration tools not yet mainstream.                                              |
| 2015         | Initial Launch of ADF                               | Launch of Azure Data Factory for orchestrating data workflows across various data stores.                                                                         |
| 2017-2018    | Introduction of ADF V2                              | Visual Data Flows, Trigger-based Scheduling, Integration Runtime, Enhanced Monitoring and Management.                                                             |
| 2018-Present | Continuous Updates and Integration with Azure Services | Regular feature updates, new connectors, integration with Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning.                                  |
| 2019-Present | Integration with Azure Synapse Analytics          | Unified analytics platform, combining data integration, big data, and analytics within Azure Synapse Analytics.                                                   |
| 2020-Present | Simplification and Advanced Capabilities          | User Experience Improvements, dynamic content, parameterization, enhanced security and management capabilities.                                                  |
