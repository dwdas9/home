## Setting Up Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is a cloud-based platform built around Apache Spark, the popular open-source, parallel-processing framework. Let's walk through the steps to set it up:

### 1. **Log into the Azure Portal**

Before you start, make sure you have an Azure account. If not, sign up for one. Once you have an account, log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

### 2. **Create a Databricks Workspace**

- In the Azure Portal, click on "+ Create a resource".
- In the search box, type "Databricks" and select "Azure Databricks" from the list.
- Click the "Create" button.

### 3. **Configure the Workspace**

You'll need to provide:

- **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription you want to use.
- **Resource Group**: You can create a new one or use an existing resource group.
- **Workspace Name**: Give your Databricks workspace a name.
- **Region**: Select a region close to you or your target audience.
- **Pricing Tier**: Choose between "Standard" or "Premium". For most users, "Standard" is enough to start with.

Click "Review + Create", then "Create" once you've reviewed your settings.

### 4. **Launch the Workspace**

After Azure has finished setting up Databricks, go to the Azure Databricks service in the portal and click on "Launch Workspace". This will open the Databricks portal.

### 5. **Set Up a Cluster**

Before you can run any Spark code, you need a cluster:

- Inside the Databricks workspace, navigate to "Clusters" on the sidebar.
- Click on "+ Create Cluster".
- Give your cluster a name, select a runtime version, and choose the type and number of machines you want. For beginners, the default settings are usually sufficient.
- Click "Create Cluster".

### 6. **Create a Notebook**

Now you can write and run Spark code:

- Go to "Workspace", select "Create", and then "Notebook".
- Give it a name, select the language (Python, Scala, etc.), and link it to the cluster you created.

You can now start writing and executing Spark code in your notebook!

### 7. **Clean Up Resources**

To avoid unnecessary charges:

- Remember to terminate clusters when not in use. They will consume resources and can lead to unexpected costs.
- If you're done experimenting with Databricks, consider deleting the resource in the Azure Portal.
