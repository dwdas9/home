When you install Spark using a package manager like `pip`, it places the Spark binaries and libraries inside the Python's `dist-packages` or `site-packages` directory. This is a different installation approach than downloading and extracting Spark directly from the Apache Spark website.

Here's what you need to know:

1. **SPARK_HOME for pip-installed PySpark**: If you've installed Spark via `pip`, then the equivalent `SPARK_HOME` would be `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/`. This directory would contain all the necessary libraries and dependencies for Spark to run within a Python environment.
2. **Configuration and JARs**: Configuration files, JARs, and other related resources would also be located within this directory structure. For instance, if you're looking for the location to place additional JAR files, it would likely be somewhere like `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/jars/`.
3. **Using `spark-submit`**: The `spark-submit` script in this directory is tailored for the pip-installed Spark and ensures that it picks up the correct libraries and configurations from this location.

In summary, if you've installed Spark using `pip` within your Docker container, then the `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/` directory is your primary point of reference for Spark configurations, binaries, and libraries. This is distinct from a standalone Spark installation, which would typically reside directly under `/usr/local/` or another directory, separate from the Python packages directory.

What if echo $SPARK_HOME or %SPARK_HOME% returns nothing and you are not sure where spark is installed? Even though you instaleld it?

Let's try a different approach.

Spark's binaries (like `spark-submit` and `spark-shell`) are often a good hint as to where Spark might be installed.

1. **Search for Spark binaries**:
   Execute the following command within your Docker container:

   ```bash
   find / -name "spark-submit" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   This command searches for the `spark-submit` binary, which is a common Spark binary. The directory containing this binary is likely your Spark installation directory.

2. Once you've located the directory containing `spark-submit`, you'll typically find Spark's home directory one level up. For instance, if `spark-submit` is found in `/path/to/spark/bin/spark-submit`, then `/path/to/spark` is likely your `SPARK_HOME`.

In my system it returned

`bash
/usr/local/bin/spark-submit
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-submit
`

How do I know where I have installed all the libraries or which is actually the right spark home?

The path `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-submit` suggests that this is the location where PySpark was installed as a Python package, likely via `pip` or a similar package manager.
