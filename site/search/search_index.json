Here's how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Partitioning: The structure <code>year=2023/month=10/day=23/hour=00.json</code> inherently sets up partitioning for the data. When converted to Parquet or other storage formats, this structure will make it incredibly efficient to read specific partitions (like all data from a particular month or day) without scanning through the entire dataset. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be read and thus speeds up queries.</p> </li> <li> <p>Column Pruning: If your dataset inside the JSON files includes multiple columns, Parquet (and other columnar formats) allows for column pruning. This means that if a particular analysis requires only a subset of columns, only those specific columns are read from the storage, saving both time and resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compression: Both Parquet and ORC are known for efficient compression. When you have data organized hierarchically, and you're storing it in a columnar format, you can achieve significant storage savings. The structure also ensures that similar data types (like timestamps) are stored together, which can result in better compression ratios.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compatibility with Big Data Tools: Tools like Spark and Hive work exceptionally well with columnar storage formats and can directly utilize the hierarchical structure for optimized data reads. If you ever decide to analyze the data using these tools, having them in this structure and format would be advantageous.</p> </li> <li> <p>Schema Evolution: One of the advantages of Parquet (and to some extent, ORC) is the support for schema evolution. If your data structure changes over time (new columns are added, for example), these formats can handle those changes gracefully. Having an organized directory structure makes managing these schema changes over different time periods more straightforward.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Long story short:</p> <p>Given these advantages, if you're considering a transition to Parquet or another efficient storage format in the future, this hierarchical structure will certainly come in handy and help in making the data storage and retrieval processes more efficient.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/LocalPython_AzureBlob.html#complete-tested-code","title":"Complete tested code","text":"<p>If you want to test the complete code together here is it.

Traditional ECM systems like SharePoint, Alfresco, and Documentum come with built-in features such as document libraries, version control, metadata management, workflow automation, compliance tools, and user access controls. MongoDB, on the other hand, does not offer these features out-of-the-box. Additionally, ECM systems have user-friendly interfaces designed for document management, requiring less customization compared to MongoDB.</p> <p>ECM systems also help meet regulatory requirements for document retention, data privacy, and security by providing built-in tools for audit trails, access controls, and document lifecycle management. They offer strong governance features to manage documents according to company policies. Moreover, ECM solutions integrate smoothly with other enterprise applications like Microsoft 365 and ERP systems, whereas MongoDB requires more development effort for similar integration. ECM systems come with ready-to-use APIs and connectors, reducing the need for custom development.</p> <p>Another advantage of ECM systems is their quick deployment with minimal setup effort. Using MongoDB would require significant custom development to achieve the same functionalities. Finally, ECM solutions come with support and maintenance services to keep the system up-to-date and secure.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/Project_SSRS_SSIS_SharePoint.html","title":"Setting Up SSRS Reports in SharePoint for a Client with 100+ Field Offices","text":""},{"location":"DE-Projects/Project_SSRS_SSIS_SharePoint.html#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>The company has over 100 field offices, from which data is collected daily using different ETL workflows.

It's HTTP-triggered, with Azure Logic Apps managing the periodic fetch schedule. The function logs activities and handles errors, and if provided a 'name' in a request, it sends a personalized greeting. For a detailed overview, please see the Comprehensive Project Summary in the appendix.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/1_Ingestion/HttpTriggered/HTTPTriggered_AzureFunc.html#choice-of-azure-services-for-data-ingestion","title":"Choice of Azure Services For Data Ingestion","text":"<p>We developed the Azure Function in Visual Studio Code on Windows using the Python V2 programming model. The V2 model simplifies Azure Function app development by allowing scheduling, binding, and the entire logic to be written in a main Python file, contrasting with V1 which requires additional setup in a JSON file. We sourced our weather data from weatherapi.com, a cost-free option that doesn't require credit card and lets you call the api almost indefinately. HTTP-triggered functions need scheduling, unlike Timer-triggered ones. We managed this with Azure Logic Apps. In terms of cost, the Azure function with a Timer-trigger is the most economical, followed by the HTTP-Triggered Azure function paired with Azure Logic App-based scheduling. For a sample cost breakdown of the Logic App, please refer to the section Calculate Azure Logic Apps Cost. Even so, for a simple hourly workflow, the expense remains minimal. It's worth noting that other options, especially Databricks, can be considerably pricier. Similarly, ADF and Synapse can also come at a higher cost. Here's a brief overview of the available options for creating an app like this:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Azure Functions (Python V2): These are ideal for small to moderate workloads and straightforward data retrieval tasks. Most of the logic is self-contained within the main Python file[V2 model], making it a cost-effective, easy-to-build choice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Azure Data Factory or Azure Databricks: For more complex workflows and efficient handling of larger data volumes, Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks offer powerful options. However, they may incur higher operational costs due to their capabilities and scalability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Azure Logic Apps: Positioned between the other options, Azure Logic Apps are suitable for uncomplicated workflows with moderate data volumes, offering a visual workflow designer for easy setup. Their cost varies based on the number of steps. While here we use Azure Functions for core logic and Logic Apps for scheduling, some opt for a single solution, like a timer-triggered Azure App or fully utilizing an Azure Logic App.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/1_Ingestion/HttpTriggered/HTTPTriggered_AzureFunc.html#lets-ready-the-prerequisites","title":"Let's ready the prerequisites","text":""},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/1_Ingestion/HttpTriggered/HTTPTriggered_AzureFunc.html#get-the-weather-api","title":"Get the Weather API","text":"<p>First, create an account at weatherapi.com.

Why Azure Data Lake?","text":"<p>We've selected Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS G2) for storing our weather data. This decision was largely driven by its seamless integration with Azure Functions, which streamlines our data collection process. Apart form this ADLS G2 also has many other advantages, like:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Hierarchical Organization: ADLS G2 allows us to neatly structure our data, similar to a directory system. We can store our weather data grouped by year, month day etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Security: The Active Directory permission can be applied to the folders and files. This makes the storage as secure as it can get.</p> </li> <li> <p>Analytics Performance: ADLS G2 is optimized for heavy-duty data analytics, ensuring efficient query operations over vast datasets.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In the next stage, we decided to convert our JSON-formatted data into Parquet. Here's why:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Analytical Efficiency: Parquet, with its columnar storage design, streamlines analytical queries, letting us access specific data without scanning the entire dataset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage Efficiency: Parquet compresses data effectively, optimizing storage use and potentially lowering costs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptable Structure: Parquet inherently carries schema information, allowing for alterations in data structure without disrupting existing data.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A noteworthy advantage of Parquet is its compatibility with various storage systems, including NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and lakehouses. This ensures that we can migrate or integrate our data effortlessly if our analytical demands change.</p> <p>To summarize, our storage strategy not only prepares our data for immediate analysis but we can also easily move it to other storage solution in future.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/1_Ingestion/HttpTriggered/HTTPTriggered_AzureFunc.html#creating-an-azure-functions-app-using-azure-portal","title":"Creating an Azure Functions App Using Azure Portal","text":"<p>An Azure Functions App acts as a host for one or more Azure Functions.

However, for more complex analytics and reporting, creating a proper data model can have several benefits, like:</p> <p>a) Faster Query Performance: - By organizing data into a structured model (like star or snowflake schema), you can optimize query performance. The data model reduces the amount of data scanned during queries.</p> <p>b) Understandability and Consistency: - Having a defined schema makes it easier for data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders to understand the data. It ensures everyone is working with data in a consistent manner.</p> <p>c) Joining Multiple Data Sources: - If you have (or plan to have) multiple data sources, a structured data model simplifies joining them. For instance, weather data can be enriched with location data, demographic data, etc.</p> <p>d) Data Integrity: - A structured data model, especially when coupled with a database or data warehouse, can ensure data integrity with primary and foreign key constraints.</p> <p>e) Improved Data Quality: - Data models can have defined constraints, ensuring that incoming data meets specific quality standards.</p> <p>Star Schema: - A commonly used schema in data warehousing. It includes a central fact table (e.g., hourly weather measurements) and surrounding dimension tables (e.g., location, date, time). It's simple and often results in fast query performances.</p> <p>Snowflake Schema: - A normalized version of the star schema.

Parquet is a columnar storage format, offering efficient data compression and encoding schemes. This format is optimal for analytic querying performance and works well with big data technologies. Converting to Parquet after validation and modeling ensures that you're storing high-quality, well-structured data, making your analytics processes more efficient.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/2_Transformation/Solution_Details.html#conversion-to-parquet-strategy","title":"Conversion to parquet Strategy:","text":"<p>When considering a robust data storage strategy, especially for data analytics and long-term storage, the structure and features of Parquet come into play. Parquet is a columnar storage file format, which is optimized for use with big data processing tools like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and many others. Here's what you should consider for the best Parquet structure:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Columnar Storage: Take advantage of Parquet's columnar storage format. This means when querying specific columns, only those columns' data will be read, resulting in improved performance and reduced I/O.</p> </li> <li> <p>Schema Evolution: One of the significant advantages of Parquet is its ability to handle schema evolution. Make sure your solution can accommodate changes to the schema over time without affecting the existing data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compression: Parquet supports various compression techniques like SNAPPY, GZIP, and more. Depending on your analytics use-case, select the compression method that offers a good trade-off between storage cost and query performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Partitioning: For your use-case, since you are already organizing by year, month, day, and hour, you should partition the Parquet files this way. This will speed up query times since only the relevant partitions need to be read.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example: <code>/year=2023/month=10/day=17/hour=13/data.parquet</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Row Group Size: Parquet organizes data into smaller row groups, allowing for more efficient column pruning. Adjusting the size of row groups can have a performance impact. The default is typically 128MB, but you might want to adjust based on your typical query patterns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Metadata: Parquet files store metadata about the data they contain, which helps in understanding the schema and optimizing queries. Ensure this metadata is kept up-to-date.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent Schema: Ensure that the schema for your Parquet files remains consistent, especially if you're ingesting data regularly. Any changes in the incoming JSON schema should be handled gracefully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Lake Integration: Since you're using Azure Data Lake Storage, ensure that the tools you're using for analytics are well-integrated with ADLS and can take full advantage of the features both ADLS and Parquet provide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular Compaction: Over time, as data gets updated or deleted, you might end up with many small Parquet files. This is suboptimal for query performance. Implement a regular compaction process to combine these smaller files into larger, more efficient Parquet files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoiding Too Many Small Files: If your ingestion process creates too many small files, it can degrade performance. Consider batching incoming data to create larger Parquet files.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Given the JSON structure you provided, you might want to flatten it out a bit for more effective columnar storage, unless you're often querying multiple subfields of <code>location</code> or <code>current</code> together. The columnar nature of Parquet means that nesting can sometimes reduce performance benefits, especially if the data is queried column-by-column.</p>"},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/2_Transformation/Solution_Details.html#appendix","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/2_Transformation/Solution_Details.html#data-processing-libraries-overview","title":"Data Processing Libraries Overview","text":""},{"location":"DE-Projects/AzureSkyWeather/2_Transformation/Solution_Details.html#data-validation-libraries","title":"Data Validation Libraries","text":"Library Why Use Cases Great Expectations Provides a robust suite for JSON data testing, documentation, and validation, ideal for complex structures with clear, definable rules and expectations, ensuring type, range, structure, and content accuracy.

You can use it to trigger any part of a CI/CD pipeline using webhooks on GitHub.</p> <p>GitHub Actions offers over 13,000 pre-written and tested CI/CD workflows. You can also write your own workflows or customize existing ones using YAML files.</p> <p>GitHub Actions is not just for CI/CD pipelines.

Completed 100 XP 7 minutes You've spent some time with your team learning the benefits of infrastructure as code and the different approaches that are available. Your company is growing at a rapid pace and your team knows it will be deploying a significant number of resources to Azure. As a team, you've decided that declarative infrastructure as code is the right approach to resource provisioning. The team doesn't want to maintain scripts that list every deployment step. Before beginning the process of building your first template, you need to understand how Azure Resource Manager works. Investigating the types of templates that are available to use with Azure will help you determine the next steps in your infrastructure-as-code strategy.</p> <p>In this unit, you'll learn about Resource Manager and the two types of Resource Manager templates.</p> <p>Azure Resource Manager concepts Azure Resource Manager is the service that's used to deploy and manage resources in Azure. You can use Resource Manager to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. You can interact with Resource Manager by using many tools, including the Azure portal. Resource Manager also provides a series of other features, like access control, auditing, and tagging, to help manage your resources after deployment.</p> <p>Terminology As you begin your cloud journey with Resource Manager, it's important to understand some terms and concepts:</p> <p>Resource: A manageable item that's available on the Azure platform. Virtual networks, virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, and databases are examples of resources.</p> <p>Resource group: A logical container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes resources you want to manage as a group. Most Azure resources are contained in a resource group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your solution.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>A small number of resources aren't contained in resource groups. These resource types are for specific purposes like managing access control and enforcing policies. You'll learn more about these resources in a later module.</p> <p>Subscription: A logical container and billing boundary for your resources and resource groups. Each Azure resource and resource group is associated with only one subscription.</p> <p>Management group: A logical container that you use to manage more than one subscription. You can define a hierarchy of management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance through inheritance.</p> <p>Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template): A template file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group, subscription, management group, or tenant. You can use the template to deploy the resources in a consistent and repeatable way. There are two types of ARM template files: JSON and Bicep. This module focuses on Bicep.</p> <p>Benefits Resource Manager provides many benefits and capabilities related to infrastructure-as-code resource provisioning:</p> <p>You can deploy, manage, and monitor the resources in your solution as a group instead of individually. You can redeploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence that your resources are deployed in a consistent state. You can manage your infrastructure through declarative templates instead of by using scripts. You can specify resource dependencies to ensure that resources are deployed in the correct order. Operations: Control plane and data plane You can execute two types of operations in Azure: control plane operations and data plane operations. Use the control plane to manage the resources in your subscription. Use the data plane to access features that are exposed by a resource.</p> <p>For example, you use a control plane operation to create a virtual machine, but you use a data plane operation to connect to the virtual machine by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).</p> <p>Control plane When you send a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives, authenticates, and authorizes the request. Then, it sends the request to the Azure resource provider, which takes the requested action. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools that are available in Azure.</p> <p>The following image shows the role that Resource Manager plays in handling Azure requests:</p> <p>Diagram that shows how Azure Resource Manager accepts requests from all Azure clients and libraries.</p> <p>All control plane operation requests are sent to a Resource Manager URL. For example, the create or update operation for virtual machines is a control plane operation. Here's the request URL for this operation:</p> <p>HTTP</p> <p>Copy PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{virtualMachineName}?api-version=2022-08-01 The control plane understands which resources need to be created and which resources already exist. Resource Manager understands the difference between these requests and won't create identical resources or delete existing resources, although there are ways to override this behavior. <p>Data plane When a data plane operation starts, the requests are sent to a specific endpoint in your Azure subscription. For example, the Detect Language operation in Azure AI services is a data plane operation because the request URL is:</p> <p>HTTP</p> <p>Copy POST https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/languages Resource Manager features like access control and locks don't always apply to data plane operations. For example, a user might not have permissions to manage a virtual machine by using the control plane, but the user can sign in to the operating system.</p> <p>What are ARM templates? Azure Resource Manager templates are files that define the infrastructure and configuration for your deployment. When you write an ARM template, you take a declarative approach to your resource provisioning. These templates describe each resource in the deployment, but they don't describe how to deploy the resources. When you submit a template to Resource Manager for deployment, the control plane can deploy the defined resources in an organized and consistent manner. In the preceding unit, you learned about the differences between imperative code and declarative code.</p> <p>Why use ARM templates? There are many benefits to using ARM templates, either JSON or Bicep, for your resource provisioning.</p> <p>Repeatable results: ARM templates are idempotent, which means that you can repeatedly deploy the same template and get the same result. The template doesn't duplicate resources.</p> <p>Orchestration: When a template deployment is submitted to Resource Manager, the resources in the template are deployed in parallel. This process allows deployments to finish faster. Resource Manager orchestrates these deployments in the correct order if one resource depends on another.</p> <p>Preview: The what-if tool, available in Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI, allows you to preview changes to your environment before template deployment. This tool details any creations, modification, and deletions that will be made by your template.</p> <p>Testing and Validation: You can use tools like the Bicep linter to check the quality of your templates before deployment. ARM templates submitted to Resource Manager are validated before the deployment process. This validation alerts you to any errors in your template before resource provisioning.</p> <p>Modularity: You can break up your templates into smaller components and link them together at deployment.</p> <p>CI/CD integration: Your ARM templates can be integrated into multiple CI/CD tools, like Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions. You can use these tools to version templates through source control and build release pipelines.</p> <p>Extensibility: With deployment scripts, you can run Bash or PowerShell scripts from within your ARM templates. These scripts perform tasks, like data plane operations, at deployment. Through extensibility, you can use a single ARM template to deploy a complete solution.</p> <p>JSON and Bicep templates Two types of ARM templates are available for use today: JSON templates and Bicep templates. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard file format that multiple languages can use. Bicep is a new domain-specific language that was recently developed for authoring ARM templates by using an easier syntax. You can use either template format for your ARM templates and resource deployments.</p>"},{"location":"DevOps/GitScenarios.html","title":"GitScenarios","text":"<p>layout: default title: GitHub Concepts parent: Devops nav_order: 1 has_children: true</p>"},{"location":"DevOps/JenkinsVsGitHubVsAzureDevOps.html","title":"Jenkins Vs GitHub Vs Devops","text":"Table of contents      {: .text-delta } 1.

It names the container, exposes the port, and sets up a volume for data:  <code>docker run -d --name mongoDB --network cms-network -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo</code> Access MongoDB Shell After starting the MongoDB container, access the MongoDB shell with this command:  <code>docker exec -it my-mongo mongo</code> Connect to MongoDB from an App Connect to your MongoDB container from any app using <code>localhost</code> as the hostname and <code>27017</code> as the port. Add a Docker Volume to MongoDB To persist data, create a Docker volume and attach it to your MongoDB container with these commands:  <code>docker volume create mongo-data</code> <code>docker run --name my-mongo -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo</code>  This creates a volume named <code>mongo-data</code> and starts a MongoDB container using this volume for data storage. Mount Host Directory in MongoDB Container You can also mount a directory from your host system into the container to store data. This is useful for backups, restores, or direct access to MongoDB files:  <code>docker run --name my-mongo -d -p 27017:27017 -v /path/on/host:/data/db mongo</code>  Replace <code>/path/on/host</code> with the directory path on your host machine where you want to store MongoDB data. This links the <code>/data/db</code> directory in the container to the specified path on your host. Custom Configuration For custom MongoDB settings, you can mount a configuration file from the host into the container when it runs. Secure MongoDB For production, secure MongoDB with authentication. Start by running the container with the <code>--auth</code> flag to enable security:  <code>docker run --name my-mongo -d -p 27017:27017 -v ~/mongo-data:/data/db mongo --auth</code>  Then, create an admin user inside the MongoDB shell."},{"location":"DockerAndKubernetes/SparkHiveHadoop/4.1_PySpark.html","title":"PySpark","text":"Table of contents      {: .text-delta } 1.

Missing Delta Lake libraries or incorrect configuration. Ensure Delta Lake is installed and correctly configured in the Spark session. Installed <code>delta-spark</code> and configured Spark with the appropriate Delta Lake JARs. <code>java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/bitnami/spark/.ivy2/cache/resolved-org.apache.spark-spark-submit-parent...</code> Spark was unable to write to the Ivy cache directory. Permission issues in the directory. Check and adjust directory permissions or set a custom Ivy cache directory. Adjusted permissions or set a custom Ivy cache directory with write permissions. <code>Permission denied: '/.local/lib'</code> Insufficient permissions to install Python packages globally. Trying to install packages globally without sufficient privileges. Use <code>pip install --user</code> or run with <code>sudo -H</code>. Installed with <code>--user</code> flag or <code>sudo -H</code>. <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/collection/SeqOps</code> A Scala version mismatch where a dependency required Scala 2.13. Using libraries compiled with Scala 2.13 with Spark compiled for Scala 2.12. Ensure all libraries match Scala 2.12 and clear any Scala 2.13 JARs. Used Scala 2.12-compatible Delta Lake JARs and cleared cached Scala 2.13 JARs. <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/collection/IterableOnce</code> Another Scala version mismatch due to Scala 2.13 libraries. Similar to the SeqOps error; mixing Scala 2.13 libraries with a Scala 2.12 Spark environment. Check library versions, ensure consistency, and clear any Scala 2.13 dependencies. Aligned all dependencies with Scala 2.12 and cleared conflicting JARs. <code>Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o37.applyModifiableSettings.</code> Spark encountered issues applying settings due to a version mismatch. Likely caused by using incompatible versions of libraries or JARs. Review and match versions of all libraries with Spark\u2019s Scala version. Ensured correct Delta Lake version for Scala 2.12 and cleared cache. <code>Cannot use io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension to configure session extensions.</code> Spark was unable to use Delta Lake extensions. Incorrect or missing dependencies, likely due to Scala version mismatch. Ensure the Delta Lake JAR matches the Scala version used by Spark. Used the correct Delta Lake JARs for Scala 2.12 and Spark 3.5.2. <code>rm -rf ~/.ivy2/cache/io.delta</code> <code>rm -rf ~/.ivy2/jars/io.delta</code> <code>rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/io/delta</code> Commands used to clear cached JAR files. Old or conflicting cached dependencies causing version conflicts. Clear Ivy or Maven cache to remove outdated or conflicting JARs. Removed cached JARs to prevent conflicts and ensure fresh downloads. <pre><code>from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom delta import configure_spark_with_delta_pip\n\n# Build the Spark session with Delta Lake support\n# - config(\"spark.sql.extensions\", \"io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\"): Adds Delta Lake SQL extensions to Spark, allowing it to recognize and work with Delta Lake features.\n# - config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog\", \"org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog\"): Configures Spark to use Delta Lake as the default catalog for managing tables.\n# - config(\"spark.jars.packages\", \"io.delta:delta-core_2.12:2.3.0\"): Specifies the Maven coordinates for the Delta Lake library compatible with Scala 2.12 and Spark 3.5.2.

Design decisions for individual applications do not prevent the addition of other applications in future. For example, an initial deployment would include ten site collections that comprises of document center, document workspace, collaborative team sites or publishing sites that compose an intranet (team sites, My Sites, and published intranet content).

USERELATIONSHIP() activates different physical relationships between tables during a query execution. CROSSFILTER() defines the cross filtering direction of a physical relationship. PATH() returns a string of all the members in the column hierarchy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udccc You have a Fabric workspace that contains a lakehouse named Lakehouse1. A user named User1 plans to use Lakehouse explorer to read Lakehouse1 data. You need to assign a workspace role to User1. The solution must follow the principle of least privilege. Which workspace role should you assign to User1?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Admin</p> </li> <li> <p>Contributor</p> </li> <li> <p>Member</p> </li> <li> <p>Viewer</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: To read the data from a Fabric lakehouse by using Lakehouse explorer, users must be assigned roles of either Admin, Member, or Contributor. However, respecting the least privileged principle, a user must be assigned the Contributor role. The viewer role does not provide permission to read the lakehouse data through Lakehouse explorer.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udccc You have a Fabric tenant that contains a workspace named Workspace1. Workspace1 contains a lakehouse, a data pipeline, a notebook, and several Microsoft Power BI reports. A user named User1 plans to use SQL to access the lakehouse to analyze data. User1 must have the following access: User1 must have read-only access to the lakehouse. User1 must NOT be able to access the rest of the items in Workspace1. User1 must NOT be able to use Spark to query the underlying files in the lakehouse. You need to configure access for User1. What should you do?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Add User1 to the workspace as a member, share the lakehouse with User1, and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add User1 to the workspace as a viewer, share the lakehouse with User1, and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Share the lakehouse with User1 directly and select Build reports on the default dataset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Share the lakehouse with User1 directly and select Read all SQL Endpoint data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: Since the user only needs access to the lakehouse and not the other items in the workspace, you should share the lakehouse directly and select Read all SQL Endpoint data. The user should not be added as a member of the workspace. All members of the workspace, even viewers, will be able to open all Power BI reports in the workspace. The SQL analytics endpoint itself cannot be shared directly; the Share options only show for the lakehouse.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udccc You use Microsoft Power BI Desktop to create a Power BI semantic model. You need to recommend a solution to collaborate with another Power BI modeler. The solution must ensure that you can both work on different parts of the model simultaneously. The solution must provide the most efficient and productive way to collaborate on the same model. What should you recommend?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Save your work as a PBIX file and email the file to the other modeler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save your work as a PBIX file and publish the file to a Fabric workspace. Add the other modeler as member to the workspace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save your work as a PBIX file to Microsoft OneDrive and share the file with the other modeler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Save your work as a Power BI Project (PBIP). Initialize a Git repository with version control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer: Saving your Power BI work as a PBIP enables you to save the work as individual plain text files in a simple, intuitive folder structure, which can be checked into a source control system such as Git. This will enable multiple developers to work on different parts of the model simultaneously. Emailing a Power BI model back and forth is not efficient for collaboration. Saving a Power BI model as a PBIX file to OneDrive eases developers access, but only one developer can have the file open at time. Publishing a PBIX file to a shared workspace does not allow multiple developers to work on the model simultaneously.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udccc **You have a semantic model that pulls data from an Azure SQL database and is synced via Fabric deployment pipelines to three workspaces named Development, Test, and Production.

These features may integrate seamlessly into the workflow of financial or insurance environments, offering out-of-the-box solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integration and Customization: Microsoft Power Automate allows for the creation of customized document capture workflows, which can be advantageous for those already utilizing the Microsoft 365 platform.

Two popular methods to do this are using the `%` operator and the `.format()` method. Let's understand how to use them with simple examples.  ## The `%` Operator  The `%` operator is a traditional way to format strings. It places values in a string using placeholders.  ### Example: <pre><code>name = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\nformatted_string = \"My name is %s and I am %d years old.\" % (name, age)\nprint(formatted_string)\n</code></pre>  Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.   Here, `%s` is a placeholder for a string, and `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.  ### More Placeholders: - `%s` - String - `%d` - Integer - `%f` - Floating-point number  ## The `.format()` Method  The `.format()` method is more flexible and was introduced in Python 3. It uses curly braces `{}` as placeholders in a string.  ### Example: <pre><code>name = \"Bob\"\nage = 25\nformatted_string = \"My name is {} and I am {} years old.\".format(name, age)\nprint(formatted_string)\n</code></pre>  Output: My name is Bob and I am 25 years old.   Here, `{}` are placeholders that get replaced by values passed to the `format()` method.  ### Using Index Numbers: You can specify the order of values using index numbers inside `{}`.  #### Example: <pre><code>formatted_string = \"My name is {0} and I am {1} years old. {0} loves coding.\".format(name, age)\nprint(formatted_string)\n</code></pre>  Output: My name is Bob and I am 25 years old. Bob loves coding.   ### Using Keywords: You can also use keywords to make the code more readable.  #### Example: <pre><code>formatted_string = \"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\".format(name=\"Charlie\", age=22)\nprint(formatted_string)\n</code></pre>  Output: My name is Charlie and I am 22 years old.   ## Conclusion  Both `%` and `.format()` are useful for formatting strings in Python. The `%` operator is simple and good for basic formatting. The `.format()` method is more powerful and flexible for more complex string formatting needs.

They are more compact and faster than traditional <code>for</code> loops.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the purpose of the <code>self</code> keyword in Python classes?</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>self</code> keyword in Python is used to represent the instance of the class. It allows access to the attributes and methods of the class within its own scope.</p> </li> <li> <p>What are decorators in Python?</p> </li> <li> <p>Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are used to add functionality to existing code in a clean and readable way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python.</p> </li> <li> <p>A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects; it references the original nested objects. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found within the original, ensuring no references to the original objects.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is exception handling in Python?</p> </li> <li>Exception handling in Python is done using <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>finally</code> blocks. It allows programmers to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Python/1_Python.html#python-object-oriented-programming-oop","title":"Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)","text":"<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that represent real-world entities.

Useful when both DataFrames are large and have a good distribution of keys. <code>spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin\", \"false\")</code><code>df1.join(df2, \"key\")</code> Broadcast Hash Join One of the DataFrames is small enough to fit in memory and is broadcasted to all worker nodes. A hash join is then performed. Efficient when one DataFrame is much smaller than the other. <code>val broadcastDF = broadcast(df2)</code><code>df1.join(broadcastDF, \"key\")</code> Sort-Merge Join Both DataFrames are sorted on the join keys and then merged. This requires a shuffle if the data is not already sorted. Suitable for large DataFrames when the join keys are sorted or can be sorted efficiently. <code>spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin\", \"true\")</code><code>df1.join(df2, \"key\")</code> Cartesian Join (Cross Join) Every row of one DataFrame is paired with every row of the other DataFrame.

Performance will be suboptimal because not all executors will be utilized at the same time.</p> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>A is incorrect because having more partitions than executors does not necessarily mean executors will be underutilized; they will process partitions sequentially.</li> <li>B is correct because more partitions than executors mean data processing cannot happen all at once, affecting performance.</li> <li>C is correct because a high number of partitions can lead to many shuffle operations.</li> <li>D is correct because managing many tasks increases overhead.</li> <li>E is correct because large data volumes can risk out-of-memory errors if executor memory is insufficient.</li> </ul> <p>Which of the following operations will trigger evaluation?</p> <p>A. DataFrame.filter() B. DataFrame.distinct() C. DataFrame.intersect() D. DataFrame.join() E. DataFrame.count()  </p> <p>Answer: E. DataFrame.count()</p> <p>Explanation: - A is incorrect because <code>DataFrame.filter()</code> is a transformation, which defines a computation but does not trigger it. - B is incorrect because <code>DataFrame.distinct()</code> is also a transformation. - C is incorrect because <code>DataFrame.intersect()</code> is a transformation. - D is incorrect because <code>DataFrame.join()</code> is a transformation. - E is correct because <code>DataFrame.count()</code> is an action that triggers the actual execution of the computation.</p> <p>Which of the following describes the difference between transformations and actions?</p> <p>A. Transformations work on DataFrames/Datasets while actions are reserved for native language objects. B. There is no difference between actions and transformations. C. Actions are business logic operations that do not induce execution while transformations are execution triggers focused on returning results. D. Actions work on DataFrames/Datasets while transformations are reserved for native language objects. E. Transformations are business logic operations that do not induce execution while actions are execution triggers focused on returning results.  </p> <p>Answer: E. Transformations are business logic operations that do not induce execution while actions are execution triggers focused on returning results.</p> <p>Explanation: - A is incorrect because both transformations and actions work on DataFrames/Datasets. - B is incorrect because there is a clear difference between transformations and actions. - C is incorrect because it incorrectly describes the role of transformations and actions. - D is incorrect because both transformations and actions work on DataFrames/Datasets. - E is correct because transformations define the computations without triggering them, while actions trigger the execution and return the results.</p>"},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.15_CommonPysparkTopics.html","title":"PySpark Concepts I","text":"<ul> <li>Some common Pyspark Topics</li> <li>Just PySpark vs Real Spark<ul> <li>Standalone Python vs. Anaconda Python</li> <li>Standalone Python</li> <li>Anaconda Python</li> <li>PySpark vs full Apache Spark Installation</li> <li>PySpark via pip</li> <li>Full Apache Spark Installation</li> <li>Conclusion</li> </ul> </li> <li>Finding Spark</li> <li>Frequently asked Pyspark questions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.15_CommonPysparkTopics.html#some-common-pyspark-topics","title":"Some common Pyspark Topics","text":""},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.15_CommonPysparkTopics.html#just-pyspark-vs-real-spark","title":"Just PySpark vs Real Spark","text":"<p>Here, I'll try to clear up the often-muddled area between PySpark and Full Spark installations.

These are basic questions that anyone using PySpark should be familiar with. So, let's get started :-)</p> <p>What is PySpark, how is different from Apache Spark?</p> <p>PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, allowing Python programmers to use Spark\u2019s large-scale data processing capabilities. Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, originally written in Scala. PySpark provides a similar interface to Spark but allows for Python programming syntax and libraries.</p> <p>What's different between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset in PySpark.</p> <p>RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is the fundamental data structure of Spark, representing an immutable, distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel. DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database but with richer optimizations under the hood. Dataset is a type-safe version of DataFrame available in Scala and Java, offering the benefits of RDDs with the optimization benefits of DataFrames.</p> <p>How do you create a SparkSession in PySpark?</p> <p>You can create a SparkSession using the <code>SparkSession.builder</code> method, often initializing it with configurations such as <code>appName</code> to name your application and <code>master</code> to specify the cluster manager. For example: <code>spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"MyApp\").getOrCreate()</code>.</p> <p>What are the advantages of using PySpark over traditional Python libraries like Pandas?</p> <p>PySpark provides distributed data processing capabilities, allowing for processing of large datasets that do not fit into memory on a single machine. It offers high-level APIs and supports complex ETL operations, real-time processing, and machine learning, unlike Pandas, which is limited by the memory of a single machine.</p> <p>What do you understand by lazy evaluation in PySpark.</p> <p>Lazy evaluation in PySpark means that execution will not start until an action is performed. Transformations in PySpark are lazy, meaning they define a series of operations on data but do not compute anything until the user calls an action. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan for efficiency.</p> <p>How can you read a CSV  in PySpark?</p> <p>To read a CSV file using PySpark, you can use the <code>spark.read.csv</code> method, specifying the path to the CSV file. Options can be set for things like delimiter, header presence, and schema inference. For example: <code>df = spark.read.csv(\"path/to/csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)</code>.</p> <p>Explain the actions and transformations in PySpark with examples.</p> <p>Transformations in PySpark create new RDDs, DataFrames, or Datasets from existing ones and are lazily evaluated. Examples include <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>groupBy</code>. Actions, on the other hand, trigger computation and return results. Examples include <code>count</code>, <code>collect</code>, and <code>show</code>. For instance, <code>rdd.filter(lambda x: x &gt; 10)</code> is a transformation, while <code>rdd.count()</code> is an action</p> <p>What are the various ways to select columns in a PySpark DataFrame? Columns in a PySpark DataFrame can be selected using the <code>select</code> method by specifying column names directly or using the <code>df[\"column_name\"]</code> syntax. You can also use SQL expressions with the <code>selectExpr</code> method.</p> <p>How do you handle missing or null values in PySpark DataFrames?</p> <p>Missing or null values in PySpark DataFrames can be handled using methods like <code>fillna</code> to replace nulls with specified values, <code>drop</code> to remove rows with null values, or <code>na.drop()</code> and <code>na.fill()</code> for more nuanced control.</p> <p>Explain the difference between map() and flatMap() functions in PySpark.</p> <p>The <code>map()</code> function applies a function to each element of an RDD, returning a new RDD with the results. <code>flatMap()</code>, on the other hand, applies a function to each element and then flattens the results into a new RDD. Essentially, <code>map()</code> returns elements one-to-one, while <code>flatMap()</code> can return 0 or more elements for each input.</p> <p>How do you perform joins in PySpark DataFrames?</p> <p>Joins in PySpark DataFrames are performed using the <code>join</code> method, specifying another DataFrame to join with, the key or condition to join on, and the type of join (e.g., inner, outer, left, right).</p> <p>Explain the significance of caching in PySpark and how it's implemented.</p> <p>Caching in PySpark is significant for optimization, allowing intermediate results to be stored in memory for faster access in subsequent actions. It's implemented using the <code>cache()</code> or <code>persist()</code> methods on RDDs or DataFrames, which store the data in memory or more persistent storage levels.</p> <p>What are User Defined Functions (UDFs) in PySpark, and when would you use them?</p> <p>UDFs in PySpark allow you to extend the built-in functions by defining custom functions in Python, which can then be used in DataFrame operations. They are useful for applying complex transformations or business logic that are not covered by Spark\u2019s built-in functions.</p> <p>How do you aggregate data in PySpark?</p> <p>Data in PySpark can be aggregated using methods like <code>groupBy</code> followed by aggregation functions such as <code>count</code>, <code>sum</code>, <code>avg</code>, etc. For example, <code>df.groupBy(\"column_name\").count()</code> would count the number of rows for each unique value in the specified column.</p> <p>Explain window functions and their usage in PySpark.</p> <p>Window functions in PySpark operate on a group of rows (a window) while returning a value for each row in the dataset. They are useful for operations like running totals, moving averages, and ranking without having to group the dataset. They are defined using the <code>Window</code> class and applied with functions like <code>rank</code>, <code>row_number</code>, etc.</p> <p>What strategies would you employ for optimizing PySpark jobs?</p> <p>Strategies for optimizing PySpark jobs include broadcasting large lookup tables, partitioning data effectively, caching intermediate results, minimizing shuffles, and using efficient serialization formats. Adjusting Spark configurations to match the job's needs can also improve performance.</p> <p>How does partitioning impact performance in PySpark?</p> <p>Proper partitioning in PySpark can significantly impact performance by ensuring that data is distributed evenly across nodes, reducing shuffles and improving parallel processing efficiency. Poor partitioning can lead to data skew and bottlenecks.</p> <p>Explain broadcast variables and their role in PySpark optimization.</p> <p>Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks. They are used to optimize performance in PySpark, especially when you have a large dataset that needs to be used across multiple nodes.</p> <p>How do you handle skewed data in PySpark?</p> <p>Handling skewed data in PySpark can involve strategies such as salting keys to distribute the data more evenly, repartitioning or coalescing, and custom partitioning schemes to avoid data skew and ensure balanced workload across nodes.</p> <p>Discuss the concept of accumulators in PySpark.</p> <p>Accumulators in PySpark are variables that are only \u201cadded\u201d to through an associative and commutative operation and can be used to implement counters or sums. PySpark ensures they are updated correctly across tasks.</p> <p>How do you handle streaming in PySpark?</p> <p>Working with structured streaming involves defining a DataStreamReader or DataStreamWriter with a schema, reading streaming data from various sources (like Kafka, sockets, or files), applying transformations, and then writing the output to a sink (like a file system, console, or memory).</p> <p>How can you handle schema evolution in PySpark?</p> <p>Schema evolution in PySpark can be handled by using options like <code>mergeSchema</code> in data sources that support schema merging (e.g., Parquet). It allows for the automatic merging of differing schemas in data files over time, accommodating the addition of new columns or changes in data types.</p> <p>Explain the difference between persist() and cache() in PySpark.</p> <p>Both <code>persist()</code> and <code>cache()</code> in PySpark are used to store the computation results of an RDD, DataFrame, or Dataset so they can be reused in subsequent actions. The difference is that <code>persist()</code> allows the user to specify the storage level (memory, disk, etc.), whereas <code>cache()</code> uses the default storage level (MEMORY_ONLY).</p> <p>How do you work with nested JSON data in PySpark?</p> <p>Working with nested JSON data in PySpark involves reading the JSON file into a DataFrame and then using functions like <code>explode</code> to flatten nested structures or <code>select</code> and <code>col</code> for accessing nested fields. PySpark's built-in functions for dealing with complex data types are also useful here.</p> <p>What is the purpose of the PySpark MLlib library?</p> <p>The purpose of the PySpark MLlib library is to provide machine learning algorithms and utilities for classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and underlying optimization primitives. It allows for scalable and efficient execution of ML tasks on big data.</p> <p>How do you integrate PySpark with other Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas?</p> <p>Integration of PySpark with other Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas can be achieved through the use of PySpark's ability to convert DataFrames to and from Pandas DataFrames (<code>toPandas</code> and <code>createDataFrame</code> methods) and by using UDFs to apply functions that utilize these libraries on Spark DataFrames.</p> <p>Explain the process of deploying PySpark applications in a cluster.</p> <p>Deploying PySpark applications in a cluster involves packaging your application's code and dependencies, submitting the job to a cluster manager (like Spark Standalone, YARN, or Mesos) using the <code>spark-submit</code> script, and specifying configurations such as the number of executors, memory per executor, and the application's entry point.</p> <p>What are the best practices for writing efficient PySpark code?</p> <p>Best practices include using DataFrames for better optimization, avoiding UDFs when built-in functions are available, minimizing data shuffles, broadcasting large reference datasets, efficient data partitioning, and leveraging Spark's built-in functions for complex operations.</p> <p>How do you handle memory-related issues in PySpark?</p> <p>Handling memory-related issues involves optimizing Spark configurations such as executor memory, driver memory, and memory overhead. Tuning the size and number of partitions, avoiding large broadcast variables, and using disk storage when necessary can also help.</p> <p>Explain the significance of the Catalyst optimizer in PySpark.</p> <p>The Catalyst optimizer is a key component of Spark SQL that improves the performance of SQL and DataFrame queries. It optimizes query execution by analyzing query plans and applying optimization rules, such as predicate pushdown and constant folding, to generate an efficient physical plan.</p> <p>What are some common errors you've encountered while working with PySpark, and how did you resolve them?</p> <p>Common errors include out-of-memory errors, task serialization issues, and data skew. Resolving these issues typically involves tuning Spark configurations, ensuring efficient data partitioning, and applying strategies to handle large datasets and skewed data.</p> <p>How do you debug PySpark applications effectively?</p> <p>Effective debugging of PySpark applications involves checking Spark UI for detailed information on job execution, stages, and tasks, logging information at key points in the application, and using local mode for debugging simpler versions of the code.</p> <p>Explain the streaming capabilities of PySpark.</p> <p>PySpark supports structured streaming, a high-level API for stream processing that allows users to express streaming computations the same way they would express batch computations on static data. It supports event-time processing, window functions, and stateful operations.</p> <p>Can you explain model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning in PySpark.</p> <p>Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning in PySpark can be performed using the MLlib library, which offers tools like CrossValidator for cross-validation and ParamGridBuilder for building a grid of parameters to search over. Evaluation metrics are available for assessing model performance.</p> <p>Name some common methods or tools do you use for testing PySpark code?</p> <p>Testing PySpark code can involve using the <code>pyspark.sql.functions.col</code> for column operations, the DataFrame API for data manipulation, and third-party libraries like PyTest for writing test cases. Mocking data and simulating Spark behavior in a local environment are also common practices.</p> <p>How do you ensure data quality and consistency in PySpark pipelines?</p> <p>Ensuring data quality and consistency involves implementing validation checks, using schema enforcement on DataFrames, employing data profiling and cleansing techniques, and maintaining data lineage and auditing processes.</p> <p>How do you perform machine learning tasks using PySpark MLlib?</p> <p>Performing machine learning tasks with PySpark MLlib involves using its DataFrame-based API for constructing ML pipelines, utilizing transformers and estimators for preprocessing and model training, and applying built-in algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, etc.</p> <p>How do you handle large-scale machine learning with PySpark?</p> <p>Handling large-scale machine learning involves leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of Spark and MLlib, using algorithms optimized for parallel processing, effectively partitioning data, and tuning Spark resources to balance the workload across the cluster.</p> <p>What are the challenges one faces while implementing machine learning algorithms using PySpark?</p> <p>Challenges include dealing with data skewness, selecting the right algorithms that scale efficiently, managing resource allocation in a distributed environment, ensuring data quality, and integrating with other systems for real-time predictions.</p> <p>\u00a9 D Das \ud83d\udce7 das.d@hotmail.com | ddasdocs@gmail.com</p>"},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.16_ConnectingSparkToHive.html","title":"Creating Delta Tables in Hive with Spark","text":""},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.16_ConnectingSparkToHive.html#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This article will explain two things: - How to create tables in Hive. - How to create Delta tables in Hive.</p>"},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.16_ConnectingSparkToHive.html#the-setup","title":"The Setup:","text":"<p>Spark: You can run this example on any Spark setup\u2014Spark clusters or PySpark.

This warning comes up because Hive can\u2019t read Delta tables directly unless special Delta support is added or managed via Spark.</p> <p>Solution: Since Delta tables are built for Spark, the simplest way is to keep using Spark to query your Delta tables. Don\u2019t register them in Hive\u2019s metastore. Instead, manage them directly with Spark to avoid Hive trying to read the Delta format.</p> <p>Note: Hive doesn\u2019t natively support Delta, but you can use Delta Lake open-source libraries to connect Hive and Delta.

This program includes the user's code that uses Spark\u2019s API to perform data processing. A Spark application can be a Python script that processes data from a CSV file, performs transformations, and writes the results to a database. Job A job is triggered by an action (e.g., <code>count()</code>, <code>collect()</code>, <code>saveAsTextFile()</code>) in a Spark application. Each action in the code triggers a new job. If your application has two actions, like counting the number of rows and saving the result to a file, it will trigger two jobs. Stages A job is divided into stages, where each stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel. Stages are separated by shuffle operations. If a job involves filtering and then aggregating data, the filtering might be one stage, and the aggregation another, especially if a shuffle operation (like a group by) is required between them. Tasks A stage is further divided into tasks, where each task is a unit of work that operates on a partition of the data. Tasks are the smallest unit of execution in Spark. If a stage needs to process 100 partitions of data, it will have 100 tasks, with each task processing one partition."},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/1.0_Spark/1.2_SparkArchitecture.html#lets-put-it-all-together","title":"Let's put it all together","text":"<p>Let's see an example to understand these concepts:</p> <ol> <li>Application: A Spark application that reads data from a CSV file, filters out certain rows, and then calculates the average of a column.</li> <li> <p>Code snippet:      <pre><code>df1 = spark.read.csv(\"data.csv\") //Job1\ndf2 = df.filter(df[\"value\"] &gt; 10) //Job2\naverage = df2.agg({\"value\": \"avg\"}).collect()\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Jobs:</p> </li> <li>Job 1: Triggered by the action <code>spark.read.csv()</code>.

A broadcast variable can only be created by an explicit call to the broadcast() operation.    - This statement is correct but not complete.

A broadcast variable is entirely cached on the driver node so it doesn't need to be present on any worker nodes.    - This statement is incorrect.

A broadcast variable is entirely cached on each worker node so it doesn't need to be shipped or shuffled between nodes with each stage.    - This statement is correct. The primary characteristic of a broadcast variable is that it is distributed and cached on each worker node.

It's important to note that these are just JARs and don't represent the full Hadoop ecosystem. </p> <p>Apache Spark is used for distributed data processing. But for data storage it relies on other systems like ADLS, S3 etc. But why, when connecting Spark to ADLS, do we bring Hadoop into the picture? Let\u2019s find out.</p> <p>Spark's Core Functionality: Spark is designed to process data, not to understand the intricacies of every storage system. It can pull data from various sources, but it doesn't always have native integrations for each one.</p> <p>Hadoop's Role: Hadoop, primarily known for its distributed file system (HDFS), also offers connectors to diverse storage systems. Over time, it has become the standard bridge between storage solutions and big data tools.</p> <p>ADLS and Hadoop Integration: When Microsoft developed ADLS, they provided a connector to the Hadoop FileSystem API. This approach made sense. Why reinvent the wheel when big data tools already communicate efficiently with HDFS via Hadoop's API?</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>HSpark uses Hadoop libraries to access ADLS due to the standardized and robust nature of the Hadoop FileSystem API. Microsoft integrated ADLS with this Hadoop API to ensure that ADLS would be compatible with a broad range of big data tools, such as Spark and Hive. This decision was to use the extensive community support of the Hadoop ecosystem and also allowed Microsoft to reuse what was already working In essence, the Hadoop API serves as a bridge between Spark and ADLS.</p>"},{"location":"Spark-DataBricks/2.0_Spark_To_ADLS/2.0_Spark_To_ADLS.html#understanding-essential-jars-for-azure-data-lake-operations-with-spark","title":"Understanding Essential JARs for Azure Data Lake Operations with Spark","text":"<ol> <li>hadoop-azure-3.3.3.jar:</li> <li>Description: This library provides support for Azure Blob Storage integration with Hadoop.

I want to create a decent warehouse on my laptop. Am I being impractical? I read somewhere a DW is for data at rest, spark is for data in motion. Well, no. Let's see what comes free with PySpark:</p> <p>Built-in Hive: PySpark comes with a small Hive setup plus a Derby database by default as the Hive metastore. This means you can create managed tables just like you did in Synapse Analytics.</p> <p>Automatic spark-warehouse folder: PySpark automatically creates a <code>spark-warehouse</code> directory to store table data. This directory is created in your working directory, and all managed tables are stored as Parquet files within this directory.</p> <p>Automatic .Parquet: When you create tables using Hive support in PySpark, the data is stored in Parquet format by default.</p> <p>Bonus! Delta Table Support: You just have to pip install delta, and then you can save the data in the enhanced Delta format, making it an even better warehouse.</p> <p>First, let me create a Spark session with Hive support.</p> <pre><code>from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Start Spark session with Hive support\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName(\"PySpark Data Warehouse with Hive Support\") \\\n    .enableHiveSupport() \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n</code></pre> <p>Then let me create a database and an empty table inside it:</p> <p><pre><code># Create a database\nspark.sql(\"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dbHollywood\")\n\n# Switch to the new database\nspark.sql(\"USE dbHollywood\")\n\n# Create a managed table\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mngd_tbl_HollywoodFilms (\n    id INT,\n    name STRING\n)\n\"\"\")\n</code></pre> THis is how the folders are getting creatd in the spark-warehouse folder:</p> <p></p> <p>Now, let me insert some data:</p> <p><pre><code>spark.sql(\"USE dbHollywood\")\n\n# Insert data into the managed table\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nINSERT INTO mngd_tbl_HollywoodFilms VALUES\n(1, 'Matrix'),\n(2, 'Inception')\n\"\"\")\n</code></pre> Wow, these parquet fiels were auto-craeted. I didnt mention any format. In hive support data is auto-stored as .parquet.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, if I query the table in teh same session I see this:</p> <p></p> <p>Now, let me stop the session and create a new session to see if things are just a one-night stand or a lifetime friendship. If I have no metatore I can't query using the table name, though the backend data  might be present.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, let me try to delete the table and then the database and see if the data goes away or not. Else, how can I call them managed tables?</p> <p></p> <p>Here is the snapshot of the spark-warehouse folder.
