## A Step-by-Step Guide to Connect Standalone Spark with Azure Data Lake

While Azure Databricks effortlessly links with ADLS thanks to shared Azure Directory infrastructure, standalone Spark setups demand meticulous JAR dependencies management in the site-packages directory. This guide walks you through connecting ADLS from standalone Spark in a Docker container and demonstrates connecting Visual Studio Code to the Docker instance to run PySpark.

## Setting up a Dockerized Spark Environment on Ubuntu for Windows

In this guide, I'll demonstrate how to create an Ubuntu Docker image fine-tuned for Python and Spark. We'll see how to connect the environment to Visual Studio Code using the Dev Containers extension. This VS extension allows you to work within a containerized environment seamlessly, offering the impression that all processes are running natively on your local machine. Ubuntu was selected as the base image due to its renowned stability, comprehensive apt-get system for handling packages, and flexibility in managing system-level packages or mimicking production setups. We considered other options like Python-focused images (e.g.,  python:3.9-slim,), Alpine Linux for its minimalism and security, and Debian which parallels Ubuntu's benefits but lacks some commercial features.

## Install Spark/Pyspark in the Anaconda Ecosystem

In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide to set up Spark/PySpark in the Anaconda ecosystem. We'll start with the installation of Anaconda based on your operating system. Then, we'll incorporate Java using Conda. Following that, we'll install PySpark and the `findspark` library, ensuring smooth integration with Jupyter. A crucial part of our guide focuses on setting environment variables. Specifically, we'll detail the process of configuring `JAVA_HOME` and `SPARK_HOME` variables and adding Java and PySpark to the system's PATH on a standard Windows setup. By the end of this guide, you'll be fully prepared to launch Jupyter Lab with PySpark, having all necessary configurations in place.
