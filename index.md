# About Me

<p> 

My technical journey spans a broad spectrum of Microsoft technologies and platforms, with a strong emphasis on cloud-based solutions, digitalization initiatives, and enterprise-level application development in the Banking, Insurance, and Fintech industries. I have experience working in diverse environments across Singapore, Amsterdam, and Canada. I have led large-scale migrations from on-premises to the cloud, developed ETL solutions, and worked in all phases of SDLC. My expertise also extends to onsite leadership, vendor management, and cross-functional coordination, successfully guiding large-scale projects from inception to completion.
